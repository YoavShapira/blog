[A very detailed, fascinating insider's account of getting PRK eye surgery](http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/my_eye_surgery_experience).  **Matt Raible** is a fellow software engineer.  Although we've never met in person, he's a virtual friend since we've used each other's open-source software projects for several years now.

  


Matt, thanks for being transparent, open, and honest, and taking the time to write [this account](http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/my_eye_surgery_experience).
