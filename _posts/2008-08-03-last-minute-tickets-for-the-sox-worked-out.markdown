Last night, as [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com) and I were heading to dinner at [Maluken](http://www.maluken.com/), I realized we had decent timing.  Our dinner would be over right around the time the [Red Sox](http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=bos) game next door was starting.  I had read and heard that scalpers drastically reduce ticket prices in the minutes after the first pitch.  
  
So I suggested, and Alli agreed, to spontaneously test out that theory.  We walked around a bit after dinner, talked to some scalpers, and bought a pair of decent tickets for the game.  We only paid a tiny amount over face value.  We paid much less than comparable tickets were selling for on [StubHub.com](http://www.stubhub.com).  
  
The game itself was great.  It's always a pleasure to be at [Fenway](http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/bos/ballpark/index.jsp), and feed off the crowd and the energy.  The Red Sox played well, with the offense finally showing up.  The new guy, [Jason Bay](http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/baseball/red_sox/view/2008_08_03_Jason_Bay_s_second_game_a_blast/srvc=sports&position=recent), got a lot of applause, and he made the crowd happy with both hitting and defense.  
  
Overall, it was a nice mid-summer evening in [Boston](http://www.boston.com).  We're lucky to live in this city.
