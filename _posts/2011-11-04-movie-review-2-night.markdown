Last night I watched the movie "2 [night](http://www.twonight.co.il/)" at the [Coolidge Corner theatre](http://www.coolidge.org/) near my house.  It's part of the [Boston Jewish Film Festival](http://bjff.festivalgenius.com/2011/films/2night_roiwerner_bjff2011), and I went with a friend (**Osnat**) who's also an Israeli originally but lived here a while, like me.  
  


  
  
We both enjoyed the movie more than we thought we would.  It was both funny (very funny at times) and deeper / more complex than I expected.
