I've been fascinated with, and wanted to buy, a round-the-world airline ticket for years now.  I've even started researching them a couple of times, but turned back due to the complexity involved.  
  
**Tim Ferriss** just had an [awesome blog post explaining most of the details of buying an RTW ticket](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2010/10/08/round-the-world-plane-ticket/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+timferriss+(The+Blog+of+Author+Tim+Ferriss)).  This blog post is mostly a bookmark for myself, and recommendation to subscribe to Tim's blog.  
  
"[How to buy a round-the-world plane ticket (that kicks ass).](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2010/10/08/round-the-world-plane-ticket/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+timferriss+(The+Blog+of+Author+Tim+Ferriss))"  
  
The post has a number of useful direct links, too, for planning your itinerary, tallying up miles and segments, confirming time tables, and validating your final plan.  Thanks, Tim!
