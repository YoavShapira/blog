It's been almost four months since I last blogged, my longest hiatus since starting this blog in 2004 (!). That's especially interesting since in one of my recent posts, I was trying to get back into the blogging routine.  
  
The good news is that life has been awesome. I've been away from blogging for the best reasons possible.  
  
I changed jobs, going from [Happier](http://www.happier.com/) to [Jana](http://www.jana.com/). Both are great companies and I'm happy with the move itself, how it was done, where I am now, and how we've all stayed friends.

Personal life is great. It's been a good, busy blur of a winter and spring, including some travel and other adventures. Can't complain.

</td></tr><tr >
<td style="text-align:center;" class="tr-caption" >Still running around in the early mornings.
</td></tr></tbody></table>The summer promises to be interesting as well, with some events and trips planned. But rather than try to catch up in big pieces, I'm going to try what I tell others: ease into blogging with small, "bite-sized" entries, so they don't take a lot of time or effort to consume.  
  
Have a great weekend, everyone!
