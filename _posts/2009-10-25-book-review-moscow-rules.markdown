[Moscow Rules](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451227387?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0451227387) is another Gabriel Allon fiction novel by [Daniel Silva](http://www.danielsilvabooks.com/books/moscow_rules.asp?id=desc).  I like Silva as an author, and I like Allon as a character, so it's not surprising I like this book as a whole ;)

I have an affinity for Israeli secret agent books, as readers of this blog probably know.  (By the way, talking about readers: it looks like FriendFeed passed GoogleReader as my top RSS subscriber source this month.  Interesting.)

  


Anyways, this book is taken directly from the [relatively recent poisoning, in London, of a former KGB agent, using a chemical substance](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/world/europe/19iht-spy.3595928.html) ([thallium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallium)).  You can substitute the name of the substance, the name of the agent who died, the name of the journalist who died earlier, and you'd get pretty close to this book.

  


Or, as NBC would put it for Law & Order, it's "ripped from the headlines!" ;)

  


The writing is good, as always.  Easy to read, easy to follow, but with surprising twists.  The master villain is suitably villainous, the hero (Allon) quirky enough to make it fun.  There is an added story line where Allon's bosses back in Tel Aviv want him to come take the top job in the service, but of course he refuses, as it's an office job and he doesn't want to be behind a desk.

  


Overall, this was a very good beach or plane read.  If you liked the other Allon books, or the other Daniel Silva books, you'd like this one as well.  The ending is absolutely excellent, and sets up the following book, which I'll review in a few minutes.
