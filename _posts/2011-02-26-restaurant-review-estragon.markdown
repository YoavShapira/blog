Earlier this week **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I had a nice [tapas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapas) dinner at [Estragon](http://www.estragontapas.com/) on the edge of Boston's [South End](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_End,_Boston).   
  
The restaurant was mostly empty since it was the middle of the week, but the atmosphere was still nice and romantic.  The decor is simple, and the menu has plenty of appetizing choices.  
  
There were numerous options using less traditional parts of the pig and other meats.  The lamb [sweetbreads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetbread) special was excellent, as was the "Pringa" featuring some bone marrow and other offal.  Really good.  
  
Service was excellent, and the drinks (a pineapple mojito and an elderflower sour) also superb.  All-in-all a fun experience, and we might well come back in the future.
