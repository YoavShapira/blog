Last weekend **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com)** and I traveled to New York City, and among other places, we had brunch at [Fig & Olive](http://www.figandolive.com/).  This place was recommended by a good friend and colleague who's also a [TV celebrity](http://www.karen-rubin.com/).

  


We had brunch Sunday at noon (when they open) at the 53rd Street location, since we were going to [MoMA](http://www.moma.org/) down the street right afterwards.

  


Brunch was good.  The salad was nice, the charcuterie plate good as well, and I had very nice salmon benedict.  Service was friendly, if a bit rushed, which might be understandable since we were in a big group of people all waiting to get in when the place opened at noon.

  


They also sell a nice selection of olives and dressings, many featuring fig as you might expect from the name.  We didn't buy any since I didn't want to lug them around to MoMA and beyond.  But maybe next time.

  


Overall, while brunch was decent, there are probably better places I'd recommend for brunch over Fig & Olive.  However, if you want to shop for some nice olive oils or vinaigrettes, this is a great place to go.
