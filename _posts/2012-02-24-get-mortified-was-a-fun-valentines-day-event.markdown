"[Get Mortified](http://radioboston.wbur.org/2011/02/14/mortified-valentine)" was a fun unusual event I went to last week.  
  
It was the day before Valentine's Day (Monday, February 13th, 2012), and it was sold out at the [Coolidge Corner Theatre](http://www.coolidge.org/)'s big room.  
  
The event was basically about 10 people, guys and girls, getting up on stage and sharing their most embarrassing love-related stories.  Some people read from their teenage diaries, some read or sang poetry they wrote to past boyfriends / girlfriends, and others just verbally shared some stories.  
  
Almost every speaker had a fascinating story to tell, and most of them told it really well.  I went with a friend, and we (like most of the audience) were laughing nearly the whole time.  
  
This is part of a series of events, with all the details available at [Get Moritifed](http://www.getmortified.com/about/).  I will keep an eye out for future events in Boston, since this one was a lot of fun.
