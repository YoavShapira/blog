Yesterday almost everyone at HubSpot went out to celebrate the second birthday of our [internet marketing company](http://www.hubspot.com).  Alyssa and Ellie did a great job organizing the event, as they always do, and I had a blast.  I think everyone had a lot of fun.  
  
We went out to [Kings](http://www.backbaykings.com/) for some food, drinking, and bowling.  Apparently we have some ringers who are better bowlers than expected.  I did just OK, but then again I bowl roughly once every 3 years, so my expectations are low.  Team spirit was evident throughout the event, which was cool.  And the new people are blending in really nicely.  
  
We posted a [bunch of pictures of Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/28849923@N05/sets/72157606323681234/) if you're curious.  
  
Happy birthday HubSpot!
