Last night **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I saw _[Up in the Air](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1193138/)_, a new movie with **George Clooney** as a much-traveling consultant who lays people off.  It was fun, entertaining, and had at least one or two surprising twists.  Overall the movie was actually deeper / more interesting / more engaging than I thought it would be.
