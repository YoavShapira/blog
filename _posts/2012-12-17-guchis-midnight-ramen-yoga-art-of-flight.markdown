Another collection of quickies from the past couple of weeks.  
  
**Yoga:**  
  
I've been enjoying yoga a lot more than in the past. I'm leaning more towards the straight-up Vinyasa Flow classes, as opposed to those with hip hop or other fast music.  
  
The music is fun and useful if you want distraction (e.g. when I run, I almost always listen to music), so the same class feels harder without music, but I like it that way.  
  
At the same time, I do really like black light yoga. The effects of the light make the class much more visually interesting.  
  
A shout-out + thank you here to **[Ame](http://www.amewren.com/)**, **[Goldie](http://goldieyoga.com/)**, **[Brenna](https://www.facebook.com/brenna.matthews)**, **[Caitlyn](https://www.facebook.com/caitlyn.graham.18)**, and **[Sarah](http://www.sarahsturgesyoga.com/)**, my fave teachers so far.  
  
Yoga has been a great way to learn more about my body, and it's definitely been helping my balance, agility, and flexibility. I still mostly suck at it, but I'm improving, and enjoying.  
  
Oh, and I have a neon-green yoga mat, which turns out to be a highly-entertaining accessory to carry on your back around the Back Bay.  
  
  
**[Guchi's Midnight Ramen](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2012/11/rtw2012-tokyo.html):**  
  
This was my #1 foodie popup to attend, but it's a little bit of a challenge to get into. Nonetheless, with the help of a good friend, I managed to snag a ticket to yesterday's GMR brunch.

It was one of the best foodie events I've been to, in Boston or anywhere, for a number of reasons. The food was delicious. There wasn't a ton of it, just proper portions for appetizer, entree (ramen of course, [uni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_urchin) and miso [mazemen](http://www.goramen.com/2009/11/what-is-mazemen.html) to be specific), and dessert. This is really nice because they usually over-feed you at these events, which never feels good afterwards.  
  
The ramen was among the best I've had, including in [Tokyo](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2012/11/rtw2012-tokyo.html).  
  
The other factor which made it an outstanding event was the company. It was mostly local tech people and entrepreneurs. I knew many of them already, met a couple of fun new ones, and the conversation was easy + flowing the whole time.

**The Art of Flight**:  
  
Went to the 3D IMAX showing of the [Red Bull film](http://artofflightmovie.com/) when it was in town a couple of weeks ago, had a blast :) Mouth agape much of the time, and again a great crowd as one might expect. Just about as many "holy s*#$!" moments as _[Further](http://www.tetongravity.com/films/jeremy-jones-further/)_, making those the two top snowboarding films of the year for me.
