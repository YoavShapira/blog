... it was a good one, like most of them.  Busier than most because I had something every evening in addition to the normal work during the day.  Brief recap just for myself, locations linked.  
  
Monday evening: [recruiting dinner](http://www.cambrew.com/) and [getting together with a couple of old friends](http://flattopjohnnys.com/).

  
Tuesday evening: non-work event.  
  
Wednesday evening: another [recruiting dinner](http://thesimilans.com/).  
  
Thursday evening: working late, debating and figuring out possible [new office](http://www.cictr.com/) layout.  
  
Friday evening: [sushi](http://www.maluken.com/) with another couple of old friends.  


  


It was busy enough that I didn't even get to watch the latest [HubSpot TV](http://blog.hubspot.com/video) episode, talking about the blogosphere.  But thankfully I get it via [iTunes](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=291345451) now, so that's easy to catch up on.

  


Other thoughts about this week:

  


-- We're contemplating having a separate HubSpot Technology blog.  For engineers, by engineers  What do you think?  Interesting?  Useful?  Waste of time?

  


-- Interviewed a bunch of people this week, all of them with great communication skills.  What a pleasure, what a difference that makes.
