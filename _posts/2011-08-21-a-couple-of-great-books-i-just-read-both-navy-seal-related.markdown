I just finished reading two Navy SEAL-related books in a row, and both are highly recommended.  I don't want to spoil the surprises with too many details, so I'll keep this brief.  
  
[http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=yoasspa-20&o=1&p=8&l=bpl&asins=0316044695&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr](http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=yoasspa-20&o=1&p=8&l=bpl&asins=0316044695&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr)[Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10](http://www.amazon.com/Lone-Survivor-Eyewitness-Account-Operation/dp/0316044695?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=yoasspa-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=0316044695) tells the story of **[Marcus Luttrell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Luttrell)** and his unit mates on an operation in Afghanistan.  The operation ("[Red Wings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Red_Wings)") went badly, and after a variety of adventures, Marcus was the only one left alive to tell this story.  It's non-fiction, but it's as fascinating as any action movie I've seen recently.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The next book I read after that is older, but it has a bunch of connections to the people in the above book.  It's called [The Warrior Elite: The Forging of SEAL Class 228](http://www.amazon.com/Warrior-Elite-Forging-SEAL-Class/dp/1400046955?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=yoasspa-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=1400046955), and among other people, it has the above Luttrell completing his initial SEAL training.

This book, too, is very well-written and fun to read.  The author, **[Dick Couch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Couch)**, is a former Navy SEAL and Captain, and as such he was given unprecedented, unlimited access to the same training he underwent himself years ago.  More than any journalist or other external party would get.  
  
The result is the most in-depth, detailed description of the training program and its purposes that I've ever.  Really fascinating.  Both books also have some side rants and discussions about US policy, the impossibility of some of the "rules of engagements" limitations, digging into warrior philosophy, and more.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Both of these books are highly recommended, great reading.  I'll close this post out with a clip from [GI Jane](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119173/), a fun movie from a few years ago, showing some small piece of Navy SEAL training.
