Today is my birthday. I'm feeling luckier and more blessed than usual, which is saying a lot, since I'm often fairly happy with my lot in life.  
  
On this birthday, I want to thank my family and friends. You all are so great, always supportive, always out there, always ready and willing to listen, give feedback, and / or just hang out.  
  
I wouldn't be who I am without you. I don't take it for granted. I appreciate it. I try to be a good friend to you all, and will keep working at that.  
  
Thank you :)
