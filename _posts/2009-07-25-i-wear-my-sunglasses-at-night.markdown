Yesterday I had my eyes examined, and my vision is no longer perfect.  I'm slightly near-sighted, meaning distant objects sometimes look blurry.  The proper medical term for this condition is [astigmatism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism_%28eye%29).  
  
It's not a bad case, at this point at least.  Most of the time I see things just fine.  Reading, TV, normal stuff is no problem.  But if I'm driving at night or sitting far away from a presentation, for example, I may need to put on eyeglasses.  
  
I'm not particularly happy about this, of course, but I'm also not terribly sad.  There are worse things in the world.  
  
[Alli ](http://allisonshapira.com)and I went eyeglass-shopping yesterday and picked out a decent pair.  It will take a couple of weeks to get here.  I'll probably post a review and more thoughts after I've played with them a bit.  
  
I'm also contemplating both contacts and refractive surgey, e.g. [LASIK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK).  I don't want to put stuff in my eyes every day, so contacts are not a likely option.  But I would love to hear your thoughts on [LASIK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK), especially if you or someone you know had the procedure done.
