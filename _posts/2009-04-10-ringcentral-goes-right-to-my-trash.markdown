The only times I've ever gotten calls from [RingCentral](http://www.ringcentral.com/), it's been recruiters and staffing people.  Those, like all unsolicited recruiter emails, go right to the trash.  Never read, never listened to.  Cold-calling and spamming just does not work, with me anyways.  Maybe one day some recruiters will get the [Inbound Marketing message](http://www.hubspot.com).

  


Obviously I have nothing against RingCentral itself.  It looks like a fine service and I wish them luck.  It's just that their only users I've met use the service for unsolicited offers.
