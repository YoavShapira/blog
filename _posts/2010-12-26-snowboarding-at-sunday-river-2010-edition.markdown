This is a very detailed account of our recent snowboarding trip.  It's mostly intended for my own self, for my records, so that years from now when I'm a better snowboarder, I can look back at this and laugh ;)  
  
Last Thursday evening **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I drove up to the [Sunday River](http://www.sundayriver.com/) resort in Maine, for a snowboarding holiday weekend.  The is an annual group trip, organized by **Rachel Hodis**, for Boston-area Israelis, and we went along this year.  (Allison has gone along for several years now, but I had not.)

Sunday River is a big resort, with eight peaks total.  Big by East Coast standards, of course.  It takes [3-4 hours to get there](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Boston,+MA&daddr=Newry,+ME&hl=en&geocode=FZ9WhgIdw7bD-ykbMT0NLWXjiTGg6GIBJL98eA%3BFXbSpgIdOeDH-ykbCvC6ANyzTDGafki862fXPA&mra=prev&sll=43.422935,-70.693495&sspn=3.159887,5.773315&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=8) from Boston, depending on traffic and weather and your car / driving style ;)  
  
We stayed at the [Grand Summit hotel](http://www.sundayriver.com/Lodging/GrandSummitHotel/), which is ski-in / ski-out, and otherwise very much like a Marriott Courtyard in style.  We had a convenient, big, clean room, which was nice.  The hotel also has an outdoor heated pool, a big hot tub, and a spa.

On the first day (Friday) I just hung out on the bunny slope most of the day, and then tried out going on a green / beginner trail with Alli.  I didn't have great success, mostly falling my way down, until Alli unstrapped and ran alongside me for the latter half of the trail.  With that help, I could ride down the rest of the trail without falling.  
  
On the second day (Saturday), I took a lesson in the morning.  The instructor, **Brad**, was friendly and cheerful and patient.  We spent most of the lesson "skating," where one foot is strapped in and one isn't, learning how to turn that way.  I guess it teaches valuable balance and/or other skills.  It was a pain in the ass, and I did much better when fully strapped in (both feet).  
  
I met Alli for lunch and then we went back to the bunny slope, this time with her instead of an instructor.  I did much better here, doing a few clean and near-clean runs, no falling, down the whole bunny slope.  It was getting easier and easier, and I felt like I was making it over a hump, which is encouraging.  At the end of the day I was pretty psyched, and ready to try the lift and green trail again the next morning.  
  
  
  
However, I did not get a good night of sleep.  When I woke up on the third day (Sunday), I didn't feel well.  I also kept forgetting and misplacing stuff when dressing up in the morning, when packing up the room, and when checking out.of the hotel.  It gave me a bad vibe, plus it was very cold outside, so I decided not to snowboard today.  With regret, too, since I was making good progress.   
  
But it didn't feel right to ride today, so I don't regret the decision.  Alli did go out, early in the morning as is her habit, and she rode a bunch before we met up in the main lodge.  She, too, was cold, so we decided to call it a day early.  We started driving back to Boston, and got back just in time before the blizzard took over the city.  
  
All-in-all, it was a great, fun trip.  Getting there and back takes a while.  The weather is cold, and although they make snow all the time (artificially), there is a lot of ice on the slope.  I really want to try / prefer the West Coast style, plenty of natural snow, and warmer temperatures.  I'd like to try that next, and primarily, in the future.  
  
But I made great progress, and with a few more sessions, I should be able to make it down green / beginner trails easily.  I look forward to that ;)  
  
Equipment update: the board ([Rossignol Circuit mid-wide](http://www.evo.com/outlet/snowboards/rossignol-circuit-mid-wide-snowboard-2010.aspx#utm_source=googlebase&utm_medium=shoppingengine)) is good, the bindings ([Rome Shift](http://www.romesnowboards.com/product/bindings/shift/)) are OK, the helmet ([Smith Maze](http://www.smithoptics.com/products/#/Snow+Helmets/Adult+Helmets/Maze/view/)) is good, the goggles (Smith, cheap ones) are meh, the boots ([K2 Transit](http://www.skis.com/snowboard-boots/c653/k2-transit-boa-snowboard-boots-2010-p166097.html)) are not feeling pretty comfortable and good.  
  
Need to work on heel-edge turns and getting up once I fall, especially on my heel edge.  I can get up on my toe edge, facing the mountain, fine.
