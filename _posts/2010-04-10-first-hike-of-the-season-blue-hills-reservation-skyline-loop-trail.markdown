This morning [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/) and I went on our first hike of the season.  We drove 30 minutes south of Boston to the [Blue Hills Reservation](http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/blue.htm).  We walked the Skyline Loop trail, which is three miles covering several of the local hills, including the highest one, Great Blue Hill.  
  
We had a blast!  I've been wanting to get into hiking this summer, and this was a nice start.  The views were beautiful, the exercise invigorating (but not very challenging -- as expected for this hike), and the outdoors nice and quiet.  It was cool enough that not that many people were around, so we had many quiet moments.  
  
The proximity to Boston can't be beat.  The trails are well-marked, blazed, and organized.  The trail map is easy to read, clear, and complete.  All in all, a great start to the season.
