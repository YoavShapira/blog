It's been an [insanely-good and intense basketball playoff series](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/090501&sportCat=nba) between the [Celtics](http://www.nba.com/celtics/game_preview/preview050209-bulls.html) and the [Bulls](http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/playoffs_2009.html).  Bill Simmons, the ESPN Sports Guy, [describes it well](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/090501&sportCat=nba) (as always).  We have a few hours until Game 7, the deciding game, but I've been stressed about it all day.
