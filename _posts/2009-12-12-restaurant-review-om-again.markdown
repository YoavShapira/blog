[Om](http://www.omrestaurant.com/) is a modern Indian fusion restaurant in Harvard Square.  The emphasis is on modern, both in look and feel (very loungey) and in food / menu choices.

  


I went to Om for dinner with **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com)** when it first opened, back in 2006.  I posted [the review here](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2006/06/om-restaurant.html).

  


Last weekend, on Saturday, we met our friends Joe and Julie for dinner there.  At first we were going to just get drinks, since the drinks at Om are amazing (and they're known for that).  But then we were hungry, so we got dinner too.

  


I had an excellent seared tuna, and everyone else had good steak.  But the drinks are the exciting part.  The French Superfly, which has a great name, was awesome.  Highly recommended.

  


Service was OK, not excellent.  Our appetizer momos were never delivered.

  


[Om](http://www.omrestaurant.com/) is a little expensive, food-wise, and I'm not sure the value is there.  But for drinks or appetizers, or to meet friends, it's a good place.
