[WoodThatWorks](http://www.woodthatworks.com/screen-savers) is a cool site in general, and now David has free screen savers that look good.  So far Quandary is my favorite, but I can see toggling between a couple of others as well.  Check them out at [http://www.woodthatworks.com/screen-savers](http://www.woodthatworks.com/screen-savers).
