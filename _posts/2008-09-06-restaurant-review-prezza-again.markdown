Once of the nicest treats for [my birthday](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2008/09/turning-30.html) is that my immediate family (parents and two sisters) flew over from Israel to celebrate with me.  We went out to dinner at [Prezza](http://www.prezza.com/) in the [North End](http://www.boston.com/travel/boston/neighborhoods/north_end/), one of my favorite restaurants in Boston and my favorite in that area of town.  
  
As always, the service was immaculate.  My sisters are a little bit picky in what they eat, but the restaurants was super-accommodating.  They not only got various mixtures of stuff on and off the menu, but it was done beautifully and presented with a great smile, no problem at all.  
  
The food itself was delicious for the most part.  Alli's lobster fra Diavolo was a little too sauced up, but my raviolini, dad's lamb chops, and the other pastas were amazing.  The desserts were all awesome.  
  
Another reason I like Prezza is the excellent wine list.  It just got another award, this one a "Best of award of excellence 2008" from Wine Spectator.  The selection is awesome, but unlike some other places (Asiate comes to mind), there is a broad range of prices.  We went with Contratto, [Panta Rei](http://contratto.it/i_pantarei.htm), which was a very good match to most things, but not amazing.  
  
Overall, I still really enjoy Prezza.  Highly recommended for special occassions and general food lovers.
