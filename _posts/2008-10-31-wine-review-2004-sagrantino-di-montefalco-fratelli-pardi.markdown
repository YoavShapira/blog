A great wine [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com) bought while in Rome this past summer.  Rich violet, nice nose, very low tannins (i.e. smooth up front), long finish.  Not very expensive, so it's a good value too.  This is mainly a note to myself to buy more bottles of [this wine](http://winelibrary.com/reviewwine.asp?item=40971&DCMP=ILC-alsolike).
