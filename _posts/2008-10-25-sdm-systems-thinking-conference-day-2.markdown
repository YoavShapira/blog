Day 2 of the [SDM Systems Thinking conference](http://sdm.mit.edu/index.php?fileName=conf08/sdm_conference.html) brought a few more interesting lectures, discussions, and fun hanging out.

  


Girish, the founder and CEO of [eClinicalWorks](http://www.eclinicalworks.com/index.php), talked about how his company applies agile product development approaches to projects with 10-year development cycles.  Unusual and interesting  They also also inbound marketers, although he didn't use the term.  A successful company in a tough space.  A good speaker.

  


[John DeVadoss](http://blogs.msdn.com/jdevados/) from Microsoft talked about their "Software + Services" strategy.  It was mildly interesting, but a lot of high-level talk, I felt, without concrete examples.  Obviously his perspective is skewed towards very large customers: at one point he referred to "small and medium size businesses, like those with 5,000 employees..." which was amusing to me.  So, a different audience with different requirements.

  


[Dhamesh Shah](http://www.hubspot.com/company/management/dharmesh-shah), our co-founder of HubSpot, was awesome, I thought.  He talked about applying agile principles (like "[release early, release often](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html)") to business models themselves.  Of course I'm biased, but I think people liked the presentation a lot.

  


All-in-all, it was a very good conference.  Probably the best one yet in this series.  Thanks [SDM](http://sdm.mit.edu) :)
