I'm so happy to have this place, [Cognac Bistro](http://www.cognacbistro.com/), right in my neighborhood, a few steps from my house.  An actual really good French bistro with authentic execution, a homey feeling, a raw bar, and great cocktails?  It's like a wish came true.

I've been to Cognac three times now, including last night with my parents, and each time has been great.  The bistro classics like steak frites are well done, as are some more interesting takes on fish (particularly the monkfish).  The cocktails are really nice and well-mixed, and the atmosphere is great.

Go [there](http://www.cognacbistro.com/).  You won't regret it.  Plus you'll be supporting a local, family-owned-and-operated restaurant.  There's free parking ;)  It's just a tiny place, so make a reservation.
