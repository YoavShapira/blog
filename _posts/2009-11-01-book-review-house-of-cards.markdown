[House of Cards: A Tale of Hubris and Wretched Excess on Wall Street](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767930894?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0767930894), by **[William D. Cohan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_D._Cohan)**, is the story of how [Bear Stearns](http://www.bearstearns.com/) collapsed last year.  It's kind of similar to _[A Colossal Failure of Common Sense](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2009/10/book-review-colossal-failure-of-common.html)_, which I [reviewed last month](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2009/10/book-review-colossal-failure-of-common.html), and which tells about the collapse of [Lehman Brothers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers) around the same time.

The author is a [Fortune magazine](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/) editor, among other things, and I think that shows in the writing.  There is a lot of quoting of people, verbatim, which is actually great.  He speeds past some of the financial topics, and I had to look a couple of them up, but that's OK.  Overall the writing is more like a novel than a documentary, which I consider a compliment / good thing.  I wasn't looking for a dry description of banking transactions, but someone to tell the inside story, and this was pretty cool.

  


I don't know if the author is objective or not.  I don't know if the story is complete or not.  The reviews on Amazon seem very split.  But I don't really care.  This was an entertaining book to read with a lot of primary source evidence, and that's what I was looking for.

  


It's pretty shocking how quickly the bank collapsed.  The first part of the book covers just the last 10 days, with all the frantic deal-making and discussions.  Seems like people worked day and night, some to save the bank as-is, and others to creatively find another solution.  But it didn't work.

  


The dealings with the government, and the egos involved, were very interesting.  It was a tough time, with some people looking for scapegoats, and others looking for one organization to fail as an example to others.

  


Overall, I enjoyed this book.  It's not exactly light beach reading, but as far as these pseudo-documentary books go, it's pretty good.
