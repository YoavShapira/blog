This past weekend **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I checked out [Aragosta](http://www.aragostabistro.com/), a bar / bistro in the [Fairmont Battery Wharf](http://www.fairmont.com/batterywharf) hotel, as part of my birthday celebrations.

We both enjoyed the location and view.  You can sit outside on the patio, or inside, and both are right on the water.  It's looking at the water and at a pier where big Coast Guard boats are parked, so that was cool.  
  
The food was pretty interesting, with some things much better than others.  The lobster crostini appetizer was excellent, and the paste were pretty good as well.  We didn't have room for dessert, but we had some excellent wine (a [Ca'Marcanda "Magari"from 2004](http://www.wineaccess.com/wine/product/10830938/2004-Ca'-Marcanda-Magari), highly recommended).  
  
Service was nice and friendly, too.  Overall, a fun place.
