On Thursday night I had dinner with some colleagues at [Clink](http://www.clinkrestaurant.com/), the main restaurant of the [Liberty Hotel](http://www.libertyhotel.com/) downtown.  It was my third time there, and it was very good.

  


My entree was monkfish and braised short ribs: delicious.  I shared a foie gras torchon appetizer, as well as some cheese and veal and ricotta meatball sliders.  All were very good.

  


Service was decent, the ambiance nice.  We tried a couple of bottles of wine, of which the [2004 Glen Carlou Grand Classique meritage](http://www.plazawine.com/2004-Glen-Carlou-Grand-Classique-Meritage-p-16503.html) was the best.  Easy to sip, went well with everything.

  


The lobby was hopping by the time we left, though still not packed.  It's a nice place to hang out.
