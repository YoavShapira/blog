**Mimzilla** is the author of a blog called "[Don't Put Chopsticks In Your Hair](http://chopsticksinhair.blogspot.com/)" which I really like.  She doesn't write very often, but she writes well, and the topics are interesting.

Her [latest post](http://chopsticksinhair.blogspot.com/2011/10/hatchec-mathced-and-dispatched.html) is about her mother's death, and the assorted funeral-related procedures in Japan.  It makes for fascinating reading, and she shares a lot more than most folks at such tough times.  
  
Read "[Hatched, Matched, and Dispatched](http://chopsticksinhair.blogspot.com/2011/10/hatchec-mathced-and-dispatched.html)."
