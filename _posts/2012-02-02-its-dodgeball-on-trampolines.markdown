This was so much fun, you should not read this blog post, and instead head to the nearest [SkyZone Sports](http://www.boston.skyzonesports.com/) venue to play.  
  


  


  
Last weekend I met up with a group of friends to play trampoline dodgeball, also known as 3D dodgeball.  I'd been wanting to do this for a year or so, since I found out about the [Boston SkyZone](http://www.boston.skyzonesports.com/) facility near us.  
  
The game exceeded my expectations, and I'll definitely do it again.  It was more of a physical workout than I anticipated: all of us were soaked and sweaty after playing for 30 minutes, and pretty beat after an hour.  
  
It was also more fun than I expected.  There's something childish, maybe, about just bouncing around on [trampolines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trampoline), including the occasional crashes.  But nonetheless, it's a blast.  
  
We do have video of us playing, but it's not on my iPhone.  I hope to get a copy soon from the person who videotaped us.  Until then, this demo video will have to do...  
  
I noticed they have bounce boards for rent at the facility.  This could be really useful for practicing kiteboarding and snowboarding tricks.  Mental note ;)
