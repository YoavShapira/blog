I was reading up on [HScale](http://www.hscale.org/display/HSCALE/Home) and [Spock Proxy](http://spockproxy.sourceforge.net/) earlier this evening, and in due time I went back to re-read some of the [MySQL Proxy](http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/MySQL_Proxy) documentation.  There's this funny, documented option that just made me laugh out loud.  I love it.
