Last week **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I came back from a great two-week vacation to Israel.  We travel there at least once a year to visit my family.  The trip is always a lot of fun, but this one was better than most.  
  
I slept late every day, went to the beach a few times, hung out with family a ton, checked out some cool new restaurants, and had a few awesome parties.  Other than that, I did nothing.  Stayed offline, no laptop, no iPhone.  It was just great: very relaxing, a good time to reflect and think about life.  
  
It's good to be back at home, as well.  But this was really a great trip.  I'll post the pictures shortly.  
  
שנה טובה !
