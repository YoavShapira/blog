Last night **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I watched the movie _[Invictus](http://invictusmovie.warnerbros.com/)_.  The movie is about [South Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa) right after **[Nelson Mandela](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela)** became the president, coming out of prison.  He's trying to make the people of South Africa get over their past troubles and move into a new future.

  


Rugby, as a popular sport, is one avenue to reconciliation, and that's what the movie is about.  The story is a bit predictable, as you get the feeling that the South African team will pull off some epic win against all odds, and they do.

  


But the movie itself, directed by **Clint Eastwood** and featuring a couple of good actors in **Morgan Freeman** (as Mandela) and **Matt Damon** (as captain of the national rugby team), is good.  It's fun to watch, entertaining, and interesting.  It's not particularly cheesy, though a bit cliche.  All in a all, a decent film.
