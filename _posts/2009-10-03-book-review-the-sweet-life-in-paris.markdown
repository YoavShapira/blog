David also has a [decent blog](http://www.davidlebovitz.com/).  I like his style of writing.  It's mildly humorous, but he doesn't try to bowl you over with crazy jokes.

  


This particular book touches on a combination of my favorites: good food, and Paris, the city.  The last time I went to Paris was in June of this year, and I wrote up some thoughts in the **[Pierre Gagnaire](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2009/06/restaurant-review-pierre-gagnaire.html)**[ restaurant review](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2009/06/restaurant-review-pierre-gagnaire.html).

  


This book has a number of funny anecdotes detailing the author's adjustment to Paris, and France.  Some are better than others, but none are boring.  The book also has a lot of recipes and comments on sourcing ingredients, which I found interesting.

  


Overall, if you like travel and/or cooking, this is a great book.  It's easy to read, funny, and insightful.
