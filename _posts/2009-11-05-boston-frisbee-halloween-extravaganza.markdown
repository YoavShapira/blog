I've written about [Boston Frisbee](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2009/03/boston-frisbee-games-on-sundays.html) before.  It's the awesome group that's open and welcoming to everyone, which plays frisbee three times a week.  I play sometimes on Sundays, on the grounds of the Boston Common.  [Logistics and other details are available](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2009/03/boston-frisbee-games-on-sundays.html).

  


On Halloween weekend, they play a game in costumes.  There are some funky special rules added for some points, contests, and more fun stuff.  This past Sunday both **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I played in our costumes, and we had a blast.

  


There are a bunch of good pictures now available on [SmugMug](http://beantown.smugmug.com/Other/bf-halloween-2009/) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=130466&id=705232104&l=142ad80b63).  I'm the orange M&M, and Alli is the yellow belly dancer.
