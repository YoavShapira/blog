It's been about a month since I [last blogged](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2010/06/great-mountaineering-article-about-jean.html), but it feels like longer.  Much has happened in the past month, and I'll try to capture some of the highlights here, if only for myself.  
  
First of all, congratulations to our good friends **David **and **Robyn**, who just had a baby girl ;)  Mazal tov!  
  
The next posts will cover our trip to Hawaii, my mountaineering course, and our Scuba diving certification experience.
