Over the past couple of weeks, a few friends have emailed to ask what I think about the [Tampa Bay Rays](http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=tb) doing so well in baseball, in the same division as the [Red Sox](http://www.redsox.com), my favorite team.  My answer has been that I actually don't mind it at all, and sometimes I even enjoy it.

  


I think competition in the division makes the Red Sox a better team come the playoffs, assuming the Red Sox make the playoffs, which I think they will.  It's also nice to have fresh competition, not the same old faces.  And as a final bonus, if said competition helps keep the Yankees completely out of the playoffs, all the better ;)
