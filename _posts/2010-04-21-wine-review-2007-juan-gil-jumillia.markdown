Another excellent wine from this weekend: the [2007 Juan Gil Jumilla](http://www.juangil.es/ing/index.htm).  This one I just picked up at a store, not a restaurant.  **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I had it Friday night at dinner with some pasta in a spicy red sauce featuring Italian sausage.  
  
It's a really good wine, and an exceptional value.  **Stephanie **said it well in [her review](http://blog.vintagecellars.com/2010/02/wine-review-2007-juan-gil-jumilla-red-at-costa-brava-restaurant/): good balance, nothing overwhelming, just a pleasure to sip (or chug).  Highly recommended.
