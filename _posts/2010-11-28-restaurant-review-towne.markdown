Last week **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I went to [Towne](http://www.towneboston.com/), a newish restaurant by the Hynes Convention Center in Boston's Back Bay.  It was a Tuesday night, but the restaurant was still fairly busy, and the bar was hopping.  
  
The menu is a curious blend of stuff: some steakhouse items, some lobster dishes, some pizza, and not a coherent theme.  But the food itself was pretty good, service very good, and the ambiance excellent.  It seems like a nice kind of place to come with friends for some drinks on the bar, before or after dinner, or maybe for some snacks.  It was too loud for a serious conversation, though, and not super-romantic.  
  
We did greatly enjoy the [2007 Banshee Napa Valley cab](http://www.klwines.com/detail.asp?sku=1061215).  It was a tad early to drink, maybe, but elegant and flavorful nonetheless.

Note: we had the 2007, but this image is of the 2008.
