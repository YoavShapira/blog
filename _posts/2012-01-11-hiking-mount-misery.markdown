Last weekend I went hiking with a friend, and we went to [Mount Misery](http://www321.pair.com/oaries/localattitude/mountmisery.htm) in [Lincoln, MA](http://www.lincolntown.org/), since neither of us had ever been there.  
  
It was a very easy hike, just walking around, with very little elevation changes.  The scenery is pretty, and the location is beautiful, but it's too easy a hike: not enough exercise.  We drove around Lincoln, Concord, and Lexington a bit, which is always fun.  We also stopped by the [DeCordova museum](http://www.decordova.org/), which was closed pending its biennial next week, but its sculpture garden was open and fun.

Not a lot to say about this one.  I probably won't go hiking there again, as I prefer more challenging trails. but for easy walking outdoors, it's good.
