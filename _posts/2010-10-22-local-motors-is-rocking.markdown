Full disclosure: I'm an advisor to and have stock in [Local Motors](http://www.local-motors.com/).

A couple of years ago, [I posted on this blog](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2008/03/local-motors-site-going-live-today.html) that a new company started a web site for open-source and crowd-sourced car design.  It's an ambitious vision to change the automotive industry.  
  
Guess what?  The company now has real revenue from real customers and they are building the first orders of their first open-source-designed car, the [Rally Fighter](http://www.local-motors.com/rallyFighter.php).  This is hugely exciting news.

There's a vibrant community with hundreds of designers, both amateur and professional, working together on cutting-edge car and component design.  It's pretty amazing to your truly, who has two left hands when it comes to mechanical stuff ;)  
  
Go, Local Motors, go!
