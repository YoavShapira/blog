On Saturday night (Valentine's Day), [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com) and I went to see [Eyal Golan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyal_Golan) in concert.  He's an Israeli singer of the "[mizrahi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrahi_music)" style of music (really, an ethnicity that's much more than simply music.)

  


The concert was awesome, a lot of fun.  It was a decent size venue at [Regis College](http://www.regiscollege.edu/), about 1000 people.  Not too big, and small enough that you're really close to the stage.

  


A few minutes into the concert, people started getting up and dancing in the aisles.  By the end of the concert, almost everyone was dancing in a semi-mosh-pit up front, including us.

  


We knew most of the songs, since we own a couple of his album.  But he had a few old songs in there we didn't know.  Overall the mix was good between slow and fast.

  


If you get a chance to see him in concert, I recommend it.
