[Jeffrey Walker](http://radiowalker.wordpress.com/2007/08/27/cancer-20-the-killer-app/) is the President of Atlassian, a company I like and respect a lot.  I use their products daily, and have always been happy with them.  What's more important, they've always treated us and me well, responding quickly and professionally to all our requests.

  


That kind of customer services, in my limited experience, only comes if the whole company from the top down is dedicated to its customers.

  


So I'm crossing fingers for Jeffrey and wishing him luck.
