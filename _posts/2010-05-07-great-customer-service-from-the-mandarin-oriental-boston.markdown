Apparently a couple of months ago I reserved a room at the [Mandarin Oriental hotel in Boston](http://www.mandarinoriental.com/boston/).  I don't remember doing it, I don't have the confirmation email (I keep those fairly religiously), I don't remember getting any calls or reminders about it.  But apparently I did.  
  
How do I know?  Because I got charged on my credit card for one such night, on the next business day ;)  
  
This was a surprise, to say the least.  Fortunately, the Mandarin Oriental has been exceptionally helpful and they cancelled the charge, refunding me the money.  Needless to stay, next time I need a hotel in town, I will stay there, out of recognition of excellent service.  
  
Well-done, [Mandarin Oriental Boston](http://www.mandarinoriental.com/boston/), and thanks!
