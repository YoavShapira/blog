Loosely collected from the past couple of weeks.  
  
[2007 Black Opal Chardonnay](http://www.thewinebuyer.com/sku20176.html), from southeastern Australia: stunning fruitiness, a great balance that's both easy to sip and satisfyingly strong.  Really nice.  Good value, too.  I have to buy more of that.  
  
2007 Villa Borghetti Pinot Grigio: not bad, but just OK.  Not enough flavor, just not that interesting.  
  
[2006 Veramonte Cabernet Sauvignon Reserva](http://www.wine.com/V6/Veramonte--Cabernet-Sauvignon-Reserva-2006/wine/94108/detail.aspx), from Chile: not bad again.  Robust and good flavor, but on the brutish and blunt side.  Nice finish.  Worth another shot, especially if I can find it cheaply.
