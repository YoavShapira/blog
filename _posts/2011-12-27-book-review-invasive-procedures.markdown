I saw _[Invasive Procedures](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/076531424X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=076531424X)_ at the airport store and bought it right away because of its author, **[Orson Scott Card](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card)**.  Card is the author of _[Ender's Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game)_, one of my favorite sci-fi novels ever.  Ender's Game is one of those books, like the Godfather in movies, that has elements imitated so often they've become cliche, but it's the original, the inspiration to many others.

Invasive Procedures is a near-future story, not as far-fetched as Ender's Game.  It's about gene therapy and bioengineering, and it's fascinating.  I don't want to spoil the story here (I never do), but it's a good, taut read.  Highly recommended.
