The [birthday paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox) tells us it only takes 23 people in a room before there's a 50% chance that two of them will have the same birthday.

  


How many people need to work for the same company before there's a 50% chance two of them get engaged?  Obviously not the same question, due to many factors.

  


I don't know the answer ;)  But I know **Jim** and **Rosanna** got engaged, and that's awesome!  Congratulations to both of you!
