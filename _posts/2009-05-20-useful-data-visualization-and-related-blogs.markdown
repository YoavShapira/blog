It's not often I blog here just as a bookmark for me (and interested readers), but [Nathan](http://flowingdata.com/2009/05/06/37-data-ish-blogs-you-should-know-about/)['s collection of data visualization blogs](http://flowingdata.com/2009/05/06/37-data-ish-blogs-you-should-know-about/) is worth a note:

Thank you, Nathan, and all other contributors to the above.
