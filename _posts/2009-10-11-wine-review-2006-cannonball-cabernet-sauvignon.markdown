[2006 Cannonball Cabernet Sauvignon](http://www.drinkcannonball.com/): This was a really fun little wine.  It's pretty cheap, retaining at $12 - $16 in our local stores as well as online, e.g. on [Snooth](http://www.snooth.com/wine/cannonball-wines-cabernet-sauvignon-2006/).

  


It's spicy, with a big punch of flavor right up front, and a smooth finish.  In other words, a crowd-pleaser.  Goes really well with red sauce pasta.
