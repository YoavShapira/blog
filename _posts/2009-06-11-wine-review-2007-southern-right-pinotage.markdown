The [2007 Southern Right Pinotage](http://www.klwines.com/detail.asp?sku=1043347) was a nice surprise the other night for dinner.  I expected it to be more blunt, since it's so young.  But it was very smooth.  Almost too smooth.  I bet in a couple of years it will be a nice balance with more power.  Overall, though, a very good wine, especially for the price around $20.

  


It's from [Walker Bay in South Africa](http://www.thewinedoctor.com/regionalguides/southafrica.shtml), a country I'd love to visit one day.

<blockquote>Wine Spectator says 90 points and the quote below, but I think that's a bit generous:
> 
> Smoky and fleshy, but with good aromatics and vibrancy to the black currant, fig, roasted sage and bramble notes. A nice minerally spine lingers through the finish. Drink now through 2010.
