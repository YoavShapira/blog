[Foursquare](http://foursquare.com) is a product / service that comes in the form of a web site and mobile applications.  I've been using their web site and primarily their iPhone application for  a few weeks now.

  


It's so much fun ;)  It reminds me of Farmville in its addictiveness.  It's, "[Designing for Social Traction](http://www.slideshare.net/bokardo/designing-for-social-traction)" ([@bokardo](http://twitter.com/bokardo)'s presentation, worth reading the whole thing) done well.

  


I've been using it every day, several times a day, since I got it.  I probably use it as much as Facebook, or at least in the same neighborhood.  It's just fun ;)

  


I love the badge aspect, just like I loved the various Farmville rewards.  I even kind of like that they don't tell you how to get each badge: some of them are hard to discover.  This can get frustrating or annoying, for sure, but it's a fine balance overall.

  


If you have an iPhone or other phone they support, try [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com) out ;)  It's cool.
