Once or twice a week, a friend or colleague asks me how to get started with kiteboarding.  I can explain it, but this video does a pretty thorough job, and (unlike most such videos) actually has nice high production values.  Watch it in 720p HD.  
  


  
  
It covers setup, launch, relaunch, landing, packing, the wind window, some safety precautions, and more. A really good video.  All you need is a trainer kite, and you can get started without going in the water, getting a harness, or anything else.  
  
Good choice of [instructor](http://www.tropical-paradise-kitesurfing.com/linn-svendsen-kitesurfing-girl.html), too ;)
