From the [Scrum development mailing list](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/scrumdevelopment/), found via the [Agile Game Development blog](http://www.agilegamedevelopment.com/blog.html):

<blockquote>  
"Scrum is great for either fixed-date variable-scope, or "fixed-scope" (which always grows) variable-date. If you're doing fixed-date fixed-scope, I recommend waterfall or RUP, which will buy you a few months to look for a new job."</blockquote>
