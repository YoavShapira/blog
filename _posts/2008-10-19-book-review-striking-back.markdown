Also this past week, I finished reading Aaron Klein's [Striking Back](http://www.amazon.com/Striking-Back-Olympics-Massacre-Response/dp/1400064279), an account of the Israeli Mossad's policy (and implementation thereof) following the 1972 Munich Olympics assassination of Israeli atheletes.

  


The book is interesting, and fairly well-written.  Most times the author manages not to sound too much like a historian, and keep the story moving.  Apparently some of the research was ground-breaking, and led to revelations of previously top-secret classified documents.  

  


It was also used to help make the movie [Munich](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408306/), I imagine.  I [liked that movie](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2005/12/munich.html) when I saw it.

  


You can also find some interviews with the author about this book, and reviews as well, online: [NPR](http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/transcripts/2005/dec/051222.siegel.html), [New York Times.](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/15/books/15masl.html?_r=1&oref=slogin)

  


Overall, it's a pretty good book.  I'm glad I read it, but I didn't learn that much new.  The most insightful pieces had to go with different Israeli prime ministers, and how they made assassination-related decisions.  That was fairly fascinating.
