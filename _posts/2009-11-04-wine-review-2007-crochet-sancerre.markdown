Usually I write wine reviews about wines I like, or wines I love.  I want to remember them, for future purchases, investments, and recommendations to friends.

  


This one is an exception.  This 2[007 Dominique et Jeanine Crochet Sancerre](http://www.snooth.com/wine/dominique-and-janine-crochet-sancerre-2007/) was not good.  We did not enjoy it, and I don't recommend it.

  


It's bland, boring.  Not really refreshing, not really powerful, doesn't quite nail any fruit.  Just meh.

  


I'm writing this because I had higher expectations for this wine, based on reviews and reading.  Oh well, live and learn ;)
