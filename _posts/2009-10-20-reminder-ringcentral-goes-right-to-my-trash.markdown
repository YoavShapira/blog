[As previously covered and explained on this blog](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2009/04/ringcentral-goes-right-to-my-trash.html).

  


In the 24 hours since [HubSpot's Series C announcement](http://www.hubspot.com/blog/bid/5176/HubSpot-Closes-16-Million-Series-C-Financing), I've been getting a ton of RingCentral calls.  I just happened to note some of them in my spam folder by accident, hence this blog post.

  


If you need to reach me, please don't use RingCentral.  Thank you.
