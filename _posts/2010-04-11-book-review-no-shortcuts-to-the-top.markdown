Three weeks ago I read **[Ed Viesturs](http://www.edviesturs.com/)** and David Roberts's "[No Shortcuts to the Top: Climbing the World's 14 Highest Peaks](http://www.amazon.com/No-Shortcuts-Top-Climbing-Highest/dp/0767924711?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=yoasspa-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=0767924711)"  Two weeks ago, I re-read it.  It's that good.  
  
Ed Viesturs is a fairly famous mountaineer.  I heard about him first when I saw the Everest IMAX movie at the Museum of Science, years ago.  The book describes a big chunk of Ed's life, climbing, thoughts on climbing, a bunch of expeditions and stories, and more.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  
  
The writing is clear, not overly verbose, very descriptive.  The stories themselves are pure gold: one high-adrenaline adventure after another.  I highly recommend it.  It's inspired me to go out and climb more.  (And do it carefully.)
