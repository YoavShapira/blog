**[Eric Ries](http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/)** is on fire.  The [latest post](http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/2009/04/built-to-learn.html) on his "Startup Lessons Learned" blog is about building a company to learn from its efforts.  Key quote: 

  


<blockquote>[If it doesn't involve new facts, it doesn't count as learning](http://startuplessonslearned.blogspot.com/2009/04/built-to-learn.html).  
</blockquote>

  
  


  
The point, of course, is that standing at a white-board and re-iterating ideas with the same people in the same room is not learning.  It might be fun, and it might even be useful, but it's not learning because there's no feedback from customers.
