Yes, I've been away from blogging for a little while.  Been busy learning to Scuba dive, hiking, preparing for a mountaineering course, watching **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** graduate from Harvard, and generally working.  More on all of those later.  
  
But last month, Alli and I met her parents in [Brookfield, Connecticut](http://www.brookfield.org/) (where she grew up), for **Dani** and **Dan**'s wedding.  I'm not putting their last names in here on purpose, but I wanted to say congratulations ;)  
  
The wedding was a lot of fun.  There was a nice family-style rehearsal dinner before-hand, and we had a variety of activities during the long weekend.  The wedding ceremony itself was beautiful, outside, in beautiful weather.  
  
I met a few fun guests,  mostly friends of Alli and Dan and Dani's, got to boat out on Candlewood Lake, and generally had a relaxing weekend without much internet or work.  
  
Also during this weekend, Dan introduced me to [ConquerClub](http://www.conquerclub.com/index.php?ref=425466), an online Risk-style game.  It's a lot of fun and I've been playing daily since.  One nice thing about it is that (in most games) you get one turn in 24 hours, so it can't consume a lot of time.
