Once again it's the weekend and I have a back-log of blogging to do.  It used to be that I had time to blog almost every day, but that's no longer the case.  That part itself is OK.

  


The question is how to deal with it.  If my blogging backlog becomes too big, it distracts me mentally.  I need to clear it out.  Should I do it in one "week in review" sort of post?  Or individual posts, as I would have given infinite time?

  


I guess it'll be a case-by-case thing.
