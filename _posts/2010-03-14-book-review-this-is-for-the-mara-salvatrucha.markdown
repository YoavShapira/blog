Last week I read **[Samuel Logan](http://www.thisisforthemarasalvatrucha.com/author.html)**'s book, _[This is for the Mara Salvatrucha](http://www.thisisforthemarasalvatrucha.com/)_.  It's a fascinating, riveting book.  
  
The [Mara Salvatrucha](http://www.thisisforthemarasalvatrucha.com/author.html), or MS-13, is a fairly notorious gang.  I like reading about gangs in general, and in particular this book was well-written, a real page-turner.  
  
I'm not going to reveal a lot of the details, because you should just read the book.  It largely covers the life and case of one informant, **[Brenda Paz](http://www.mahalo.com/stub/brenda-paz)**, weaving in a background of the gang and its history, customs, processes, norms, etc.  
  
Really, really good book.
