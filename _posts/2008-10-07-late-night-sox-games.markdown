Just like last year, these late-night [Sox](http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=bos) games are making people tired ;)  A couple of people mentioned it at work today, and I imagine those same people are watching the game right now, just like me.  It's OK ;)  We're all a bit tired, but it's good to be a sports fan and have a team to cheer for. 

  


It's also a sort of bonding experience, if a bit indirect.

  


Go Sox!
