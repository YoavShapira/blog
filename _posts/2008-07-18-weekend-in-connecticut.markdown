Last weekend [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com) and I went down to [Brookfield, Connecticut](http://www.brookfield.org/), her home town.  We met her parents, who came up from Florida, as well as her best childhood friend, Dani, whose parents hosted us.  
  
It was a great weekend.  The house is on [Candlewood Lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlewood_Lake) and our hosts are avid watersports enthusiasts.  They have all the gear for wakeboarding, water skiing, boating, fishing, and more.  It sure makes the activities easier and more fun when you have all the gear ready.   No need to rent it or pay anything.  
  
Candlewood Lake is beautiful and fun.  Our hosts made some great food and are just cool.  If you're reading this, thanks again ;)
