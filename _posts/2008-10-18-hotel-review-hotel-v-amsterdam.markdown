While in [Amsterdam](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2008/10/long-weekend-in-amsterdam.html) last weekend we stayed at [Hotel V](http://www.hotelv.nl/hotel_amsterdam/home/) in [Fredriksplein](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rlz=1C1GGLS_en-USUS291&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=hotel+v+frederiksplein+amsterdam&spell=1) (a square in the city).  We always like to stay at small, hip boutique hotels.  We usually shun networks.  Not because they're bad, but because we're looking for a more unique experience.

  


Amsterdam has a whole bunch of hotels to offer, including notable boutiques like the Dylan.  But our good friend Maria, who lives and works in Amsterdam, recommended Hotel V.

  


It was a very good call.  The hotel is great.  Good-sized rooms, excellent service, fun warm comfortable lobby, good location, and a good price.

  


The location is not amazing but it's very convenient.  It's within walking distance to everything, and is literally right on the #4 tram.  You can be in the center of everything in 5-10 minutes.  But it's not on a canal.  I would have liked to stay on a canal.  We'll do that next time.

  


I really have to say service was above-and-beyond at this hotel, from start to finish.  The staff was friendly and cheerful, available 24 hours a day, and helped with all of our requests without any trouble.  The free fast internet was nice as well.
