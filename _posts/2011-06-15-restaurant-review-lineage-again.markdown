[Lineage](http://www.lineagerestaurant.com/home/) is a small local seafood (primarily) restaurant in [Brookline](http://goo.gl/maps/15xp), near where I live.  I've reviewed it before, but had not been there in a year or so.

Last week **[Alli](https://allisonshapira.com/)** and I took my mom for dinner there, and it was great.  Awesome food, good service, good atmosphere, good wine selection, all in a local neighborhood place.  
  
I really liked it.  And this didn't fit in 140 characters on Twitter, so it's a blog post ;)
