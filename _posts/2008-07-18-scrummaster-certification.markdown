On Monday and Tuesday this past week, I spent the day attending a [ScrumMaster certification class](http://www.scrumalliance.org/training).  The ScrumMaster, as the name implies, is one of the roles in the [Scrum agile product development framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29).  I wanted to learn more about the system so I can better implement it at the home of [internet marketing experts](http://www.hubspot.com), HubSpot.  
  
The class was taught by [Ken Schwaber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Schwaber), one of the "inventors" or founders of Scrum.  He was great.  He had a lot of good examples, funny stories, and he didn't mess around.  I like teachers who cut through pleasantries and just convey a lot of information.  
  
I won't go too  much into detailed about Scrum or the course.  I do like the framework because it does not try to do too much.  It's not a silver bullet and does not claim to be one.  Instead, it's a set of simple rules to help improve transparency and communications.  We'll see how it works ;)
