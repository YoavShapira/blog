Yesterday **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I went snowboarding.  It was my first session in about a decade, since I last went in college.  Even back then, I went a bunch of times, but never actually tried to learn the techniques, the fundamentals, well.  I mostly just went down the mountain as fast as I could, fell often, got up, and kept going.  
  
This time I want to learn how to do it right.  I took a lesson yesterday morning, practiced by myself a bunch, and practiced all afternoon with Alli as my guide.  It was a blast.  I still fell a lot, of course, but I was getting better as the day went on.  
  
We have a trip scheduled over Christmas with a bunch of Boston-area Israelis.  I look forward to that.  
  
Expect some gear reviews and photos in the future. ;)
