Over the weekend **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com)** and I had a bottle of the [2005 Huntington Petite Sirah](http://volunteer.blogs.com/winewaves/2007/01/huntington_wine.html) at dinner, matched with some nice steaks.  It was a very nice wine, rich and robust.  The match with the steaks was very good.  I think veal, venison, or well-braised meats would have been amazing.

  


The wine itself is cheap, a good value.  It's like black ink in color, low tannins, nice finish.  I got it mostly because it's the same guy who makes the _[Rex Goliath](http://www.rexgoliath.com/rexgoliath/home.jsp)_ label, whose [2005 Cab](http://www.rexgoliath.com/rexgoliath/catalog/view_product.jsp?product_id=1006&cat_id=1) is one of my favorite value reds of the past couple of years.
