On Saturday, May 5th 2012, also known as [Cinco de Mayo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinco_de_Mayo), I ran an outdoor obstacle race, the "[run for your lives](http://runforyourlives.com/)" zombie 5K.  
  
It was a blast.  I don't actually like running that much, since I find it mentally boring, and I don't like the odds of [injuring](http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-241-285--13841-0,00.html) one's joints.  Yes, I do other equally (or more) dangerous sports, but I've never liked running that much.  
  
But this race was unusual, with obstacles, mud, and zombies chasing you around.  You had a belt with three flags on it, and if they got all three, you were "dead."  You could still finish the race, but your time wouldn't be recorded.  
  
I ran with a fun team I organized, consisting of six people total.  Only one of us finished "alive," and he had one flag.  But we all had a great time.  I'd definitely do this race again.  
  
It's not a particularly challenging event in terms of fitness, but avoiding zombies adds an element of interval training and agility that you don't find in the standard 5K race.  And, again, it's a lot more fun :)  
  
The event company posted [pictures](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.385310604843976.79218.149347058440333&type=3) on [their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.385310604843976.79218.149347058440333&type=3), too, if you're curious.  I don't have any good pictures myself, since I didn't carry my iPhone, afraid it'd get destroyed like the rest of my race outfit.
