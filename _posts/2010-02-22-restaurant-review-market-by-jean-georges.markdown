I know if you read this blog, it seems like I don't do much besides eating.  I do like eating in general, eating out all over the place, no doubt about that.  But I've actually lost weight over the past couple of months, and I'm doing well according to my doctor.

  


Also, I do work >60 hours a week on any given week, and often more, and I exercise regularly, and I've been losing weight.  So... ;)

  


Last night **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com)** and I met up with our good friends **Iva** and **Demetri** at _[Market by Jean-Georges](http://marketbyjgboston.com/)_, the [eponymous famous chef](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Georges_Vongerichten)'s latest Boston outpost.  It's the house restaurant of the new W Hotel downtown, and it's got a buzzing, hopping lounge right next to it.

  


In fact, the lounge is so popular that there's a big line outside on most weekend nights.  Thankfully we told the bouncer we had dinner reservations, and he had the restaurant's dinner list printed in front of him, so he could confirm.  We skipped the line.

  


Dinner was actually superb.  It was better than I expected, since I'm not a huge fan of outpost restaurants where the main chef is not present most of the time.  But this changed my mind somewhat.

  


I had this breaded tuna sashimi appetizer which was delicious, and a spectacular striped bass entree.  Alli and Iva also got different fish, which were exceptional, and Demetri got to-die-for lamb chops.  Seriously the best lamb chops and the best fish I've had in years.  (Yes, we all tasted each other's food: what else would you expect of foodies?)

  


Service was good.  Not stellar, but no major complaints either.

  


The atmosphere was excellent.  The place is hopping and busy, but not too crowded, not too loud.  Good background music, good lighting, good ambiance.

  


Since the other three people had cocktails, I didn't order any bottles of wine.  I did get two glasses, one white and later one red, which were OK but nothing to write home about. 

  


We both plan to come back to Market for more dinners, and apparently they have a decent brunch as well.  Highly recommended, especially if you like fish, as they were exceptional.
