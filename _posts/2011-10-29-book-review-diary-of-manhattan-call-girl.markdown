A couple of days I finished reading [Tracy Quan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Quan)'s novel, "[Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0609607243/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=0609607243)."  This novel was recommended by a friend (who is not a call girl ;)) and it was a strange, but good, read.

It was a bit meandering at times.  There are a bunch of side stories, of which some are amusing, and others are less interesting.  But the main story is so stressful, I felt stressed myself while reading it.  It does resolve well at the end, but I didn't think it would.  
  
I think that's a compliment to the author, who managed to take me along for a ride and convey some real stress, and then surprise at the end.  
  
An interesting book.
