I don't eat a ton of salad (I should probably have more).  But when I do, I'm biased towards this simple Israeli version, because my mom and grandmom make it almost every night.  
  
It's a very simple recipe, very simple salad, just fresh and delicious.  Plus SmittenKitchen always has nice pictures ;)
