I watched the movie _[Yes Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068680/)_ a few days ago.  I had low expectations for this movie, since it looked like a fairly stupid idea.  But I like **[Jim Carrey](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000120/)**, and I had some time, so...

  


The movie was actually a pleasant surprise!  It was both funnier and more profound than I expected.  It's still not a master piece of film-making, it's still predictable, and it's not even as good a comedy as some recent ones like _[The Hangover](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2009/06/movie-reviews-hangover-taking-of-pelham.html)_.  But it's worth a rental.
