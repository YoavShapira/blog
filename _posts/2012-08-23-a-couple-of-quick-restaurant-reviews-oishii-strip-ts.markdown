Although I'm mostly writing about my round-the-world trip (see [#rtw2012 posts](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/search/label/rtw2012)) right now, I don't want to develop a big backlog of other activity-related items. Hence a couple of quick reviews.  
  
<table cellpadding="0" align="center" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" ><tbody ><tr >
<td style="text-align:center;" >[![](https://yoavshapira.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/db533-img_3132.jpg?w=300)](https://yoavshapira.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/db533-img_3132.jpg)
</td></tr><tr >
<td style="text-align:center;" class="tr-caption" >Salmon on fire at Oishii
</td></tr></tbody></table>[Oishii Boston](http://oishiiboston.com/) was the first sushi restaurant I went to once I landed back in the US. It was delicious and beautifully-presented, as always.  
  
The "salmon on fire" is worth getting, if only for the presentation. The maki were good, and I didn't go [omakase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omakase) this time (since I was sharing the food with a friend who said she wasn't that hungry...).

The sake selection has room for improvement, but overall, I really enjoyed this place. It comes the closest to Tokyo out of all the places in Boston, easily.

Earlier this week I went to [Strip T's](http://stripts.com/), a small restaurant in Watertown, out of the main culinary areas of Boston. The place had been getting much press and traction thanks to a new chef, who used to be a chef at one of my all-time favorite restaurants, [Momofuku Ko](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2012/01/restaurant-review-momofuku-ko.html) in New York City.  
  
<table cellpadding="0" align="center" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" ><tbody ><tr >
<td style="text-align:center;" >[![](https://yoavshapira.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/16dec-img_3255.jpg?w=300)](https://yoavshapira.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/16dec-img_3255.jpg)
</td></tr><tr >
<td style="text-align:center;" class="tr-caption" >Japanese eggplant banh mi
</td></tr></tbody></table>  
I had been there before, but didn't review it apparently. I don't know why. I had the same appetizer as last time, the Japanese eggplant [banh mi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1nh_m%C3%AC), because it's so good.  
  
This time I also tried their buttermilk fried chicken, although I hardly ever order fried food, based upon a friend's a recommendation. It was good. My friend has the smoked rainbow trout entree, and I think that was better.  
  
<table cellpadding="0" align="center" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" ><tbody ><tr >
<td style="text-align:center;" >[![](https://yoavshapira.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/b3e9f-img_3259.jpg?w=300)](https://yoavshapira.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/b3e9f-img_3259.jpg)
</td></tr><tr >
<td style="text-align:center;" class="tr-caption" >Smoked rainbow trout -- delicious.
</td></tr></tbody></table>  
The service was great, as before. They make you feel like family, in a good non-pushy way. The place is very very loud, which I don't mind, though some might.
