Earlier this week [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com) and I completed our summer project, which was to start watching the TV show [Lost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)) and catch up on all the episodes to date.  Yup, we watched all four seasons, probably spending more at Blockbuster than we did the past few years combined.

  


It was a blast.  We like the show now, and enjoyed watching the episodes.  The combination of natural and paranormal is the alluring piece, and the characters are very interesting.  Sometimes the flashbacks and flash-forwards are confusing, but not that often.

  


We'll probably wait for the fifth season on DVD rather than watch it on TV.  We don't have that much patience for commercials, and don't watch enough TV at all to merit a Tivo.
