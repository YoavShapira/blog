I don't know if it's a good or bad thing that I have little time to blog these days.  
  
[HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com/) is definitely on a hockey stick curve, in or entering the steepest part.  It's been really busy, but all good stuff.  The new HubSpotters added last month, like [Dan](http://www.dandunn.org/blog/), [Karen](http://www.gormandizing.com/), [Adam](http://adam.ierymenko.name/), and [Erin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/erincolbert), are impressive.  We're assembling an awesome collection of talented individuals.  
  
Things have been busy at [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) as well.  [Microsoft's a sponsor](http://apache.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/07/25/2135202), [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) is putting out new releases (though I haven't put any new code in them myself, I try to test and check stuff), and the [Incubator](http://incubator.apache.org/) is cranking as always.  
  
This past week SDM, the best program for [engineering management education](http://sdm.mit.edu/), had its summer business trip, and I helped organized an informal dinner for alumni and current students on Thursday.  [Sam](http://www.cybersam.org/) did most of the work, and he did well.  We had a good turnout and a nice mix of old and new.  
  
[Local Motors](http://www.local-motors.com/), one of the companies I advise, is doing awesome.  Just check out the [latest design competition](http://www.local-motors.com/), it's jaw-dropping.  
  
The night before, [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/) and I joined [Jeremy](http://jeremy.haber.googlepages.com/) and Jeff for a mid-summer BBQ in the rain.  Thanks for hosting, Jeremy!  Today we're going to another BBQ, this time at [Eric](http://efsavage.com/blog/)'s.  After that, we're meeting [Ilana](http://www.ilanadavidi.blogspot.com/) and Dan (who are attending the [Sox - Yankees](http://redsox.com/) game today).  Tomorrow we're hosting a small brunch for a couple of other friends.  
  
And this is a relatively quiet week ;)  But as I always tell myself (and anyone in hearing distance), better to be busy than bored ;)
