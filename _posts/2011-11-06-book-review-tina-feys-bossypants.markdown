I read **[Tina Fey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Fey)**'s "[Bossypants](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316056863/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0316056863)" on vacation in Israel last month.  I don't remember why I picked it up, but one day I saw it in the Kindle app, and it fit my mood.

It's a light-hearted funny book with plenty of interesting stories.  There's a few rants and raves in there, but they're mostly very entertaining, and well-written as you might expect given Tina Fey's professional experience.  
  
A fun book to read on a beach day (as I did) or on a snowed-in day (as are forthcoming...)
