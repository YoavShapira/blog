"[Everything You Know About Fitness is a Lie](http://www.mensjournal.com/everything-you-know-about-fitness-is-a-lie/)" is a recent [article in Men's Journal](http://www.mensjournal.com/everything-you-know-about-fitness-is-a-lie/), written by Daniel Duane.  
  
I don't read this magazine and I don't know the author.  But I really liked the article.  It's a little lengthy / verbose, but worth reading.

I also forwarded the article to my friend **[Chris Keller](https://twitter.com/#!/ckeller)**, who's a fitness guru and keeps up with a lot of the research in the field.  He approved of it for the most part, so now I might actually try it out.  
  
By the way, Chris also owns and operates a cool email reminder / follow-up service called [followup.cc](http://followup.cc/).  You might want to check it out.
