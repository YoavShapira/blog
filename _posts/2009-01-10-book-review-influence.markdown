I just finished reading [Robert Cialdini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini)'s [Influence](http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/0688128165), and I can't recommend it highly enough.  It's a fantastic book everyone should read.

  


The book is based on a lot of psychology and sociology research by many scientists, not just the author.  It ties together all these experiments and observations into the six broad ways by which we are influenced to make decisions.  Authority, reciprocity, social proof, and three other principles are explained in detail and with a lot of examples.

  


It's the kind of book where the author doesn't need to convince you.  Every point is intuitively true and it just makes sense.  You've known it all along.  The author just ties it all together into a consistent theme, explains why things work the way they do, provides tips on knowing when you're being unduly influenced, and helps deal with those situations.

  


It's one of the few books I've read recently that are actually changing the way I look at life.  That's pretty high praise.

  


Even just now, when finishing the [EVOO restaurant review](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2009/01/restaurant-review-evoo-again.html), I felt a need to link to my earlier, first review of the restaurant.  I was happy to find that I was consistent in both reviews.  Cialdini talks about this principle, our human need for self-consistency, and how people can take advantage of it.

  


Read it.
