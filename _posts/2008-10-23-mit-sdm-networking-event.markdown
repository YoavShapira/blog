This week is the [MIT SDM](http://sdm.mit.edu/) "business trip" where distance students come to town.  Not by coincedence, it's also the annual alumni conference, now re-christened as the [Systems Thinking conference](http://sdm.mit.edu/index.php?fileName=conf08/sdm_conference.html).

  


As an aside, the conference features many interesting speakers.  You should swing by and check it out.  I attended a couple of talks today and they were very good.

  


Another cool thing this week is that we held a networking event for alumni and current students.  I helped organize and host it, but really it's not much work.  Helen Trimble did all the hard work, I just had fun and helped here and there.

  


The event was at the [Cambridge Brewing Company](http://www.cambrew.com/) (CBC), and we had a very good turnout.  Some other SDM bloggers already covered it, so I won't add much.  It seems like there enough fuel on the fire that we could have a monthly or bi-monthly social thing with good success.

  


Thanks to SDM for sposnsoring this!

  


Tomorrow I'm spending most of the day at the conference, so I'll probably have more to blog about.
