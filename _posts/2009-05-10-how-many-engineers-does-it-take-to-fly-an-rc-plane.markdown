Last Tuesday the HubSpot dev team got together to celebrate [Cinco de Mayo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinco_de_Mayo).  Besides the usual entertainment, we had a new toy: a cool [RC plane](http://www.rc-airplane-world.com/) bought as a gift by our very own Tom C, a fellow HubSpottah.

  


So naturally, after a few beers and some good Mexican food, we went outside to try to fly this puppy.  Hilarity ensues, not to mention some epic failures ;)

The videos are also on YouTube.  Here's the playlist: [http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=D4C4198C4FAC25B5](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=D4C4198C4FAC25B5)
