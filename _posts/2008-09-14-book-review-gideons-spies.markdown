Continuing my blogging backlog clearing process...

  


[This book](http://www.amazon.com/Gideons-Spies-Secret-History-Mossad/dp/0312252846) was not as good as I thought it would be, unfortunately.  It's just too verbose.  What I was really hoping for was a bit more spy thriller-style writing, and a bit less biography.  I guess that's my fault ;)

  


Obviously the author, [Gordon Thomas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Thomas), has done a lot of research on the [Mossad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad) and its history.  It's relayed here along with a bunch of tangents, some more interesting than others. 

  


Overall a decent book.  It's definitely worth reading of you're interested in espionage and its impact on international relations.
