It's a question I ask myself as well.  I think I have two reasons.

  


The first one is not directly related to the Kindle.  I've been reading a little less recently.  Work has been super busy, I've been [traveling on weekends](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2010/02/new-york-city-weekend-february-2010.html) a bit, and we've got a busy social life.  That's all good.

  


The second one is that I've been reading a few books in physical format, because my friends and/or colleagues (often the same people) bought the books I had on my wish list anyways.  We've got an active book exchange going at work, and some interesting tastes.  Right now I'm reading **[Daniel Pink](http://www.danpink.com/)**'s _[Drive](http://www.danpink.com/drive)_, on loan from **[Dan](http://www.abdinoor.com/)**.  So the limited reading I've been doing has been in old-school paper format.

  


I still like the Kindle as a product.  I had a good experience with it, as I've blogged in the past.  I use it on planes for reading, to take books with me when I travel, etc.  I'm curious to try the iPad in the same capacity, too.  But it's interesting that my Kindle has mostly been sitting idle besides my bed for weeks now.

  


Want to buy a slight used, like-new Kindle DX for a great price? ;)
