A rare occurrence when two of my favorite topics, data visualization, and _[Seinfeld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld)_ (the TV series), combine!

  


Found on [FlowingData.com](http://flowingdata.com/2009/09/02/the-world-of-seinfeld/), one of the best visual blogs on the web, and done by **[Ricky Linn](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rickycantdraw/)**.
