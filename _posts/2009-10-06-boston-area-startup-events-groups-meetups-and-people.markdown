I often get asked where to find out about hot and happening startups in the Boston area.  [These events and people](http://dev.hubspot.com/bid/27175/List-of-startup-oriented-events-meetups-and-people-in-Boston), compiled into a great list by Don Dodge[](http://dondodge.typepad.com/about.html), are probably the best way.  I linked to Don's list and added a couple of people / events on the [HubSpot dev blog](http://dev.hubspot.com/bid/27175/List-of-startup-oriented-events-meetups-and-people-in-Boston).
