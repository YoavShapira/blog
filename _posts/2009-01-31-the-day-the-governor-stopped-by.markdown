We have many happy days at HubSpot (and some days full of stress, too, like every startup).  But today was extra-cool.

  


A bunch of us saw the [Governor ](http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=gov3utilities&sid=Agov3&U=Agov3_Deval_Patrick_welcome_msg)[Deval Patrick](http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=gov3utilities&sid=Agov3&U=Agov3_Deval_Patrick_welcome_msg), our state's governor, was going to visit our building (One Broadway, home of the [Cambridge Innovacation Center](http://www.cictr.com/)), to learn and share ideas about how to bring more startups to Massachusetts, create good jobs, bring innovative products to market, etc.

  


So some HubSpotters used [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/) to ask the governor to swing by our office.  And he did ;)  In person, for a while, with his whole staff.  You can see the notes [here](http://twitter.com/rickburnes/status/1160667164), [here](http://twitter.com/mvolpe/status/1161731417), [here](http://twitter.com/dunster/statuses/1161929618), and [here](http://twitter.com/karenrubin/statuses/1162028122) (there may be others too).

  


It was a very cool surprise.  I give the governor and his staff a lot of credit for their flexibility and openness.  I shook the governor's hand and said hi, as did a bunch of HubSpotters.  He was patient, friendly, and accomodating.  He was even willing to pose with a HubSpot t-shirt and for a group picture with us.
