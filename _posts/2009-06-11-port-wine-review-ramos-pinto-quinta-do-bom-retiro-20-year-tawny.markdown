The Ramos Pinto Quinta do Bom Retiro 20 year tawny is the best port I've ever had.

  


I don't say that lightly.  It is the perfect balance of flavors, just the right smoothness, a true pleasure to drink.

  


**[Gerald Boyd](http://www.winereviewonline.com/Boyd_on_Ramos_Pinto.cfm)**[ sums it up well](http://www.winereviewonline.com/Boyd_on_Ramos_Pinto.cfm), and gives it 95 points, which is super high for a port:

  


<blockquote>The color is bright and richly tawny with no hints of red.  Up-front ripe dried fruit, with traces of iodine and rancio mark the aromatic nose.  The flavors are richly textured, high-profile fruit, smooth and supple that carry through to the length finish.  This 20-Year Tawny is the perfect choice between the more youthful 10-Year and mature 30-Year.</blockquote>

  


This is a single quinta tawny, which is more rare than the usual distributions.  It was last bottled in 2005, but like most tawnys, contains grapes from multiple vintages blended together.
