Yesterday I went to my first Red Sox game of the season, with my friend **[Dan](http://www.dandunn.org/).**  
  
It was a blast: a beautiful ~70-degree Saturday afternoon at Fenway Park, the Red Sox beating a disliked division opponent (Tampa Bay), and lots of good conversation.  
  
Former HubSpot employee and current Red Sox DJ **TJ** (not a typo, a DJ named TJ) [saw](https://twitter.com/#!/senatorjohn/status/191344577653911554) our [tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/dunster/status/191273389808287744) from the game, and played a courtesy song for us on the loudspeaker, which was awesome.

Great start to the season. Â Both Dan and I will be there (separately with other friends, but I'm sure we'll meet up to say hi) in the big Red Sox - Yankees [100th Anniversary](http://mlb.mlb.com/bos/fenwaypark100/index.jsp) game coming up Friday afternoon.
