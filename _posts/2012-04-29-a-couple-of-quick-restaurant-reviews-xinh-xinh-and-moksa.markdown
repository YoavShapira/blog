[Xinh Xinh](http://www.yelp.com/biz/xinh-xinh-boston): sketchy-looking place but best [pho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho) in Boston.  Hat tip to my friend **Sam**, an Asian food fan,  for sharing.  Also some really interesting juices you can only get in Chinatown.

[Moksa](http://moksarestaurant.com/): fun, creative new place in [Central Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Square_(Cambridge)), serving Asian-style tapas.  Really fun menu, lots of good options, and good, interesting cocktails.  It's a new place so both food and service execution leave something to be desired, but I think it will be ironed out in a matter of weeks.  Really nice outdoor dining option in Central Square, too.
