A couple of days ago I got back from a trip to China with Alli and a number of friends, for Hua and Christine's (Chinese) wedding.  I've got a bunch to blog about, from the trip itself to the number of books I read, and unrelated items.

  


None of the next ten or so posts have anything technical in them.  They're all personal, and you may wish to speed-skip past them.
