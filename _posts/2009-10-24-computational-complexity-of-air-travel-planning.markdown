The [Complexity of Air Travel Planning](http://www.demarcken.org/carl/papers/ITA-software-travel-complexity/ITA-software-travel-complexity.html) is a wonderful free online presentation by **[Carl de Marcken](http://www.demarcken.org/carl/index.html)**, co-founder and former CTO of ITA Software.  It was forwarded to me by my colleague **Steve L**, who used to work at ITA as well.  Thanks, Steve!
