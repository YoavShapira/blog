It seems like it's been forever since I last blogged.  Nine days, I guess ;)  It has not been an intentional pause, just a busy period both at work and at home.

  


At [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com), sprint 10 concluded with some nice successes, and sprint 11 is off!  We keep improving individually and as a team.  Some things are clicking really well, which is nice to see, but we still have a good amount of work to do.

  


At home, my parents were here from Israel.  My dad is back in Israel now now, and my mom will be around a little while longer before traveling back.

  


While my dad was here, we went to game 5 of the [Celtics](http://celtics.com) playoff series with the Orlando Magic.  That was a lot of fun: a nice comeback win, high energy.  Unfortunately the series ended with a loss, and that was the end of the season ;(

  


But the weather is beautiful, and now the evenings are a bit more free to do some exercise and outdoor activities.  w00t for that ;)
