[IE8](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx) looks better than its predecessors, acts somewhat faster.  Still not nearly as fast or fast-feeling as [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome).  Perception is important.  Sites render OK, [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com)'s product works, 10-minute experiment over, no need to go back to IE.

  


Really, someone, please do [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) for Chrome!  Then I'd be all set.
