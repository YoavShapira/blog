Last night [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com) and I went to see the movie [Taken](http://www.takenmovie.com/).  It was a good, simple, fun action film.  I loved how bad-ass the main actor is in the movie, and how it was straight and simple, through and through.  

  


I didn't feel like a thinking movie.  Maybe because I'm deeply immersed in the book I'm reading now, [The Gulag Archipelago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gulag_Archipelago), which provides for plenty of thinking.  (Review of that one forthcoming.)

  


Anyways, the acting is OK, the story is OK, the action fun.  It's a nice relaxing film.
