On Thursday night I watched, and then met, one of the best public speakers I've ever seen.  I see a lot of them, so for me anyways, that's a high compliment.

  


[Shai Agassi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Agassi), founder and CEO of [Better Place](http://www.betterplace.com/), was amazing.  He explained the project and its challenges, why it's important, why they're going about it with their particular approach, and more. 

  


He was friendly, confident, knowledgable, and best of all, he explained complex topics in easy-to-understand ways.  I was blown away, even having seen some of the same material on YouTube.

  


[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com) organized the event, and several other events Shai did in town.  [She's blogged about it already](http://allisonshapira.com/2008/12/06/shai-agassi-the-beauty-of-both-content-and-delivery/), as [did](http://blog.local-motors.com/2008/12/watched-shai-agasi-speak-tonight-at.html) my pal [Jay](http://blog.local-motors.com/2008/12/watched-shai-agasi-speak-tonight-at.html), the founder and CEO of [Local Motors](http://www.local-motors.com/), who was in attendance as well. 

  


By the way, Local Motors is having another cool design competition right now: go vote!
