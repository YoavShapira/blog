This is one of the questions I get most often from commenters on this blog.

  


I'm a little surprised to get it, since I never blogged that much about work.

  


These days, I write my work-related blog posts on the [HubSpot dev blog](http://dev.hubspot.com), at [dev.hubspot.com](http://dev.hubspot.com).  They are not many nor frequent.  Some blog posts could belong here too, as the work vs. professional development split is not always obvious.

  


A good example is our recent blog, with the videos of **[Eric Ries](http://dev.hubspot.com/bid/32028/Eric-Ries-Lean-Startup-talk-at-MIT-videos)**['s Lean Startup talk at MIT](http://dev.hubspot.com/bid/32028/Eric-Ries-Lean-Startup-talk-at-MIT-videos) last month.  It's something I think a bunch of people might be interested in, but it was HubSpot-sponsored, too.

  


I have the HubSpot dev blog set up to Tweet on my behalf when a new post is published.  That way my Twitter and Facebook followers get the post headline and link automatically.  (Follow me at [@YoavShapira](http://twitter.com/YoavShapira) on Twitter if you want.)

  


But anyways, that's the answer.  I still blog a little bit about work, but when I do, it's not here.  Subscribe to the [HubSpot dev blog](http://dev.hubspot.com) and follow us there.  There are much better bloggers than me who write there.
