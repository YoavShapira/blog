Yesterday I attended a couple of good talks at the [MIT Systems Thinking conference](http://sdm.mit.edu/index.php?fileName=conf08/sdm_conference.html), formerly known as the [MIT SDM](http://sdm.mit.edu) Alumni conference.

  


The first talk was by [Peter Senge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Senge), of [Fifth Discipline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Discipline) fame.  He talked about how reducing your company's carbon footprint and doing other environmenaly-friendly work can improve your company's profitability.  It's perhaps counter-intuitive, but he is a good speaker and had a variety of good examples.  You can see [the abstract](http://sdm.mit.edu/index.php?fileName=conf08/abstracts/senge.html) here, and videos will be online soon.

  


Next up I listened to [Oli de Weck](http://esd.mit.edu/Faculty_Pages/deweck/deweck.htm) talk about the importance of adaptability and chaneability in systems.  He was my System Project Management professor and I really liked him then.  He is a good speaker and has good examples.  You can see his [talk abstract here.  ](http://sdm.mit.edu/index.php?fileName=conf08/abstracts/deweck.html)His group also has a web site at [strategic.mit.edu](http://strategic.mit.edu).

  


Then I went back to the office, but I came back for the last talk of the day.  [Valerie Casey](http://sdm.mit.edu/index.php?fileName=conf08/speaker_bios.html#casey), head of "Software Experience" at [IDEO](http://www.ideo.com/), gave a pretty interesting talked about "[Networked Culture and the New Cartographers](http://sdm.mit.edu/index.php?fileName=conf08/abstracts/casey.html)."  She was a good speaker, especially when she got into it and ad-libbed a bit.  IDEO is a company I really like, mainly for their super-creative vibe.

  


I'm also [Twittering](http://twitter.com/YoavShapira) from the conference.

  


Thanks to the SDM [engineering management program](http://sdm.mit.edu) and staff for organizing and sponsoring the conference!
