On Sunday evening, my sister Noa and I watched [He's Just Not That Into You](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1001508/).  It's a simple, fun comedy in the [Swingers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117802/) style.  It's not quite as good as swingers, but it has its high moments.  We enjoyed it.

  


[Scarlett Johansson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0424060/) does a good acting job, as does [Ginnifer Goodwin](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1045423/).  Most of the others are just average.  Nonetheless, the story is good enough to merit renting the film.
