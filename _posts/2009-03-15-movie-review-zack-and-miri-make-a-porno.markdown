On Friday, [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com) and I watched [this movie](http://www.zackandmiri.com/) with my sister Noa, who's visiting from Israel.  As the name suggested, this is not a high-brow film.  It has no preconceptions or claims.  It's just a simple, crude, fun comedy.  Exactly what we wanted ;)

  


The film is fairly funny.  It's worth the rental price.  I'm a [Seth Rogen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Rogen) fan so it was nice to see him in full force.  The other characters from the Clerks series of films were also fun to observe.

  


Not much to say here.  If you're looking for some simple laughs, this is a decent candidate.  It's not nearly as good as [Superbad](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0829482/) or [Knocked Up](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478311/), but it's not horrible.
