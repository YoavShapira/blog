I go through my RSS reader every morning.  Yes, I'm obsessive about it.  I star or otherwise note good articles for blogging later.  Rarely does a quick  hit make me blog immediately, but this one did it.

  


Chuck Rossi, a release engineer at Facebook, posted [an entry on the Facebook Engineering public blog](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=59150988919).  It has little details, but talks about how they release code.  The developers do it with virtually no phase-gating (re: classic waterfall).

  


Key quote: "changes you make in the code will be in front of your mom and 175 million other people in less than 60 minutes."

This follows a post by an IMVU developer last week, on how they often deploy to production every 15 minutes!  (That's not a typo).  See Tim Fitz's blog post here: [http://timothyfitz.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/continuous-deployment-at-imvu-doing-the-impossible-fifty-times-a-day/.](http://timothyfitz.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/continuous-deployment-at-imvu-doing-the-impossible-fifty-times-a-day/)

  


Rock on, Facebook and IMVU!  I hope we'll be able to do the same.
