Unless you can read Hebrew (or are happy with translation software), you probably want to skip this blog post.  
  


My dad, **[Oz Shapira](http://www.hadassah.org.il/English/Eng_SubNavBar/TheDoctors/ShapiraOz.htm)**, and his drive to get a nation-wide database of surgery statistics in Israel that is open and free to all, was recently featured in a [Haaretz article](http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1111026.html).

  


The full version in Hebrew is at [http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1111026.html](http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1111026.html).  I can't find an official English translation, unfortunately.  The author of the article is **Dan Eben**, and it was published on August 30th 2009.

  


This is a noble effort and I hope it succeeds.  Such databases are widely accepted and used in the US and other countries, to the benefit of patients, doctors, insurance companies, and everyone else.
