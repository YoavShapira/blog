Apparently it has. That's the longest I've gone without writing here since this blog started in 2004, I think. Wow.  
  
Well, I've got a lot to share. It's been a fun, busy summer, filled with sports, travel, food, and other adventures. I also want to finish blogging about my trip around the world last year (#[rtw2012](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/search/label/rtw2012)).  
  
Time to get (re)started, I supposed. I'm going to try and write 2-3 times per week for the next few weeks to catch up.  
  
Knowing all the stuff I want to write about is like a weight, a hassle, a bother in the back of my mind. It'll be good to get it out.  
  
Just so this post is not entirely devoid of content, here's a video I've found motivating over the past year: [Welcome to the Grind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so0qslHYJpw).

As with most of these videos, some pieces are cheesy, but some did connect, e.g.  
  


<blockquote>Luck is the last dying wish of those who wanna believe that winning can happen by accident. Sweat, on the other hand, is for those who know it's a choice.</blockquote>
