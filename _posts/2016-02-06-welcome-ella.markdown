I really don't blog often these days. It's been busy, for sure, but in the best way possible. I also find myself using short-form sites, such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YoavShapira), more often.

On December 10th, **Lisa** and I had a baby :) **Ella** is an amazing, healthy, fast-growing baby girl. I'll spare everyone the new parent talk. We're lucky, and we appreciate it.

I took about three weeks completely off to spend at home with Lisa and Ella, then worked a couple of weeks part-time, then went fully back to work. Jana is a flexible place to work in many ways, including paternity leave. I love our mission and my colleagues, so going back to work was easy. I do, however, miss spending more time at home with the ladies.

Our parents have been here since Ella was born, in various combinations: first my mom and dad, then just my mom, then Lisa's mom, and now EllaÂ + Lisa are home with her family for a few days. My little sister was here too, on a school exchange program, so she got to spend a lot of time with her new niece :) Their help has been welcome.

We also found a nanny a few weeks ago, and she's been a blessing. It's helped us all find a new balance between baby duty and the rest of our lives.

Clearly there has not been as much going out or traveling, but that's both temporary and OK. We already have several trips planned with Ella later this year. She took her first flight at ~6 weeks old, and she did well.

I'm proud to say I haven't slacked much on training. There were a few nights where I was up with Ella for big chunks of the night, and those morning are tough. But other than that, I've been pretty good.

Happy new year, everyone! I hope your early 2016 has been good.
