A recap for myself.

  


Friday night: sushi at [Maluken](http://www.maluken.com/) with Marnie and Ken, learning about their experiences in Japan.  Fascinating.  After-dinner drinks at [The Foundation Lounge](http://www.thefoundationlounge.com/), where the music rocked.

  


Saturday: some work, grocery shopping for dinner.  I think I had lunch with a friend but it's escaping me right now.

  


Saturday dinner: hosted a few [Kennedy School](http://www.hks.harvard.edu/) students, plus [Dharmesh](http://onstartups.com/) and [Kirsten](http://kirsten.net/).  Interesting debates.  Had a blast.  Some [good wine](http://corkd.com/wine/view/58064-2005_Bears__Lair_Cabernet_Sauvignon) and sake consumed.

  


Sunday brunch: with Igor and Robyn at [The Fireplace](http://www.fireplacerest.com/home/).  Good house-cured salmon pizza.  Long walk on the [Esplanade](http://www.esplanadeassociation.org/).  Birthday party for [Ondine](http://missosdiary.com/std.blog?o=profile_p) at the new [Sel de la Terre](http://www.seldelaterre.com/) in the [Mandarin Oriental](http://www.mandarinoriental.com/boston/).  No time to watch football, but plenty of fun otherwise.

  


And this week starts HubSpot [sprint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCRUM) 5.  Should be fun ;)
