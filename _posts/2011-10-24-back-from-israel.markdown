It's been a few weeks since my last post, but for a good reason ;)  I was visiting my family in Israel, an annual trip at this point.  
  
This time I stayed for a full three weeks, longer than normal, because we had a lot of events going on.  My sister **Noa** gave birth to a beautiful baby daughter (**Yuval**), and my cousin **Shira** also gave birth, to a beautiful baby boy (**Amit**).  Mazal tov!  
  
There's also the high holidays, Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, and I got to celebrate both of them with my family.  Plus a lot of time at the beach, a trip to [Eilat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilat) for Scuba diving (beautiful), quality time with my cousins, and some going out to nice new bars and lounges.  
  
All in all, it was a great trip, a combination of relaxation and fun.  I didn't take a camera, so I don't have a lot of pictures.  I also stayed nearly completely offline, which explains the quiet on this blog.  The normal schedule should resume soon.
