title: Dark matter is like the old ether?

Yesterday I finished reading the latest [MIT Technology Review](http://www.technologyreview.com/) issue.  It's fascinating, as always.  
  
One article was talking about [dark matter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter), [dark energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy), and how so many scientists are focused on finding out what they are, how to quantify them, etc.  
  
I'm not sure why, but this really reminded me of the old scientific notion "[ether](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether)," which was later found out to be amusingly naive.  It was completely displaced by numerous advances in molecular biology, chemistry, and other fields.  
  
I wonder if 20-100 years from now, our kids will look back at our current terms of "dark matter" or "dark energy" and kind of laugh, the way we do now about ether.  Maybe that's just the way of things ;)
