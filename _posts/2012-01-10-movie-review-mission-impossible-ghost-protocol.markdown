Last weekend I saw the movie _[Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229238/)_ (MI4) with a friend.

There's not a lot to say about this movie: it's exactly what you'd expect.  The action sequences are great, the special effects and equipment is amazing, the plot is cheesy, and the acting is all over the place.  
  
My favorite scene, by far, is the one at the [Burj Khalifa](http://www.burjkhalifa.ae/) in Dubai.  Wow.  
  
What made it fun and worth our while is that we watched it on a big IMAX screen with amazing sound.  There were a couple of scenes, at least, where much of the theatre was just gawking at the screen, mouths agape.  That was entertaining.
