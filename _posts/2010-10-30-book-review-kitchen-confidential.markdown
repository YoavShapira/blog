After reading [_Medium Raw_](http://www.amazon.com/Medium-Raw-Bloody-Valentine-People/dp/0061718947?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=yoasspa-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=0061718947) earlier this month ([reviewed here as well](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2010/10/book-review-medium-raw-by-anthony.html)), I wanted to read **[Anthony Bourdain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain)**'s earlier book, _[Kitchen Confidential](http://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Confidential-Updated-Adventures-Underbelly/dp/0060899220?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=yoasspa-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=0060899220)_.  So I read it this week, and it did not disappoint.

I really enjoyed this book.   
  
As a foodie who cares about technique, menu composition, ingredients, and preparation (not just the final look and feel), the book offers a fascinating glance into the inner world.  It's limited mostly to New York City and mostly to non-Michelin-starred restaurants, but that's more than OK.  The author is honest about context, and actually explores other areas (Provinicetown, Tokyo) and other chefs (**[Scott Bryan](http://newyork.metromix.com/restaurants/article/the-updated-life-of/1017500/content)** has an excellent chapter focused on him and Veritas).  
  
Sure, the writing is verbose at places, rambling in others, and sometimes less than crystal-clear.  But the stories are great, and the personalities greater.  Even allowing for some exaggeration or embellishment, this is a very cool book.  
  
By the way, it seems like Scott Bryan is [back in NYC, cooking at Apiary](http://newyork.metromix.com/restaurants/article/the-updated-life-of/1017500/content).  That sounds interesting...
