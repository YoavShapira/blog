This is probably boring unless you speak Hebrew, but I want to save it for my own records.  It's a[ video from channel 2's national evening news](http://www.mako.co.il/news-channel2/Channel-2-Newscast/Article-3d7ae09c34e5721004.htm), aired on March 14th 2010, about a recent surgery performed by my dad.  
  
Even if you don't speak Hebrew, the 3D heart scan animations are cool.  The area in red is the tumor around the heart that was removed in surgery.  They took out the heart, put it in an ice bowl to cool it, removed the tumor, and then re-implanted the heart.  Or something like that.
