As you [may](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0Kt5PxQ8I) [have](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu0ZT7NvKQA) [seen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3orzyc6HC8M) [before](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3orzyc6HC8M), we have a [Foosball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foosball) table by the dev team area at our [awesome internet marketing](http://www.hubspot.com) company, and we take advantage of it.  This month we're doing a company-wide [March Madness Foosball doubles tournament](http://foosball.grader.com/marchmadness/), and it started yesterday.

  


Here is the [video of game 1 of the tournament](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hubspot/3351706099/in/set-72157615204875228/), and [some still photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hubspot/sets/72157615204875228/).  Thanks to [Ellie](http://www.elliemirman.com/) for capturing and posting the footage.  There will be more in the coming days and weeks.  


  


The reason this is rare footage is because game 1 featured our two co-founders, [Brian](http://www.hubspot.com/company/management/brian-halligan) and [Dharmesh](http://www.hubspot.com/company/management/dharmesh-shah/), playing [HubSpot TV](http://www.hubspot.tv) star [Karen](http://www.gormandizing.com/) and metalsmith extraordinaire Amy, and this was Dharmesh's first-ever Foosball game at HubSpot.
