A couple of weeks ago I [reviewed](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2012/02/book-review-hunger-games.html) the first book of [_The Hunger Games_](http://www.thehungergames.co.uk/) trilogy, also called The Hunger games: [read that first](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2012/02/book-review-hunger-games.html).  
  
During the subsequent 36 hours, staying up much of two nights, I finished the next two books, _[Catching Fire](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O86FMW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003O86FMW)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=yoasspa-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B003O86FMW)_ and _[Mockingjay](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XF1XOQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003XF1XOQ)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=yoasspa-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B003XF1XOQ)_.  They're addictive, easy to read, entertaining, and highly recommended.  
  
Just like the [Matrix movies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_%28franchise%29), I think the first book is the best.  But just like the Matrix movies, you kind of can't stop until you're done with the trilogy.  It's that gripping.  
  
I don't want to spoil the plot, so I won't reveal any details here, but I can't wait for the movie next month.  
  
And there's no way I'm writing a blog post that mentions the Matrix without plugging one of its many awesome scenes.
