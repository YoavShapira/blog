Last night Alli and I joined a few friends to celebrate a birthday, by going out to O Ya.  This is a fun, modern, great Japanese restaurant near South Station in Boston.

  


Before writing this blog post, I looked back at my review from the first time I went to O Ya, a little more than a year ago: [original O Ya review](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2008/07/restaurant-review-o-ya.html).

  


To my pleasant surprise, I would say just about the same things now that I said back then.  The food is incredibly good: awesome, impressive, delicious, any good adjective you want.  Some of the dishes were the same as last year, others new, others I don't remember.

  


It's still definitely worth checking out if you're a foodie and/or you have a special occasion, or, ideally both ;)  Because it's still just as expensive.

  


The only differences from last time was that I learned not to order dessert at all.  Instead, we order another round of our favorite couple of main dishes from the tasting menu.  The chutoro and the potato chip, to be specific.

  


Even better, this time we've got awesome pictures, courtesy of **[Karen](http://www.karen-rubin.com/)** ;)  Check them out on flickr at [http://www.flickr.com/photos/45276448@N03/sets/72157622940437168/](http://www.flickr.com/photos/45276448@N03/sets/72157622940437168/).
