Happy [Passover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover) everyone!

  


Two nights ago we celebrated [Passover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover) by hosting our first one here at home.  My dad was here from Israel (for the [Final Four](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2009/04/final-four-2009.html), reviewed earlier today), and my parents- and brother-in-law, [Allison](http://allisonshapira.com)'s family, came up from Florida as well.

  


It was a fun, traditional [Seder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_Seder) meal.  Alli cooked a bunch of great food, her parents and my dad helped out a lot, and I basically cleaned up ;)

  


One of the things that make our family Seders special is the amount of singing by everyone involved.  This year, although we had several friends with us who don't really celebrate Passover regularly and don't know the songs, they caught up immediately.  They sang with us all the time and led the singing by the end of the night.

  


Happy [Easter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter) as well!
