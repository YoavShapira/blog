This morning I read **Stefano**'s blog post, [The "Trail of Candy" design pattern](http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/339/).  It's a great post, as usual on his blog.  You should read it...

  


... welcome back ;)  Stefano's post reminded me of an earlier blog article, from 2008, about "[Rescue the Princess](http://www.lostgarden.com/2008/10/princess-rescuing-application-slides.html)" as a product design pattern.  This is over on **Danc**'s [Lost Garden](http://www.lostgarden.com/index.html) blog.  You should read that too...

  


The issue I often struggle with is how to implement this kind of pattern, which I think is awesome, with a business audience.  [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com), where I work now, is mostly a B2B company.  We sell to other small and medium businesses.  They are very results-oriented, and I'm not sure how they'll put up with a gaming metaphor.

  


I don't have an answer.  All ideas are welcome...
