I must have driven by [Kolbeh of Kabob](http://www.yelp.com/biz/kolbeh-of-kabob-cambridge), a little casual hole-in-the-wall restaurant in [Cambridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts), 100 times.  Probably more.  Never went in.  
  
But my friends **Ziv** and **Orit** live nearby, and they really like this place.  So we went there for dinner on Friday night.  
  
It was surprisingly delicious!  The menu is what you'd expect: kebabs, falafel, and some similar dishes.  Everything came out hot, fresh, and tasty.  The prices are cheap, the service is decent, and the atmosphere not bad.  
  
With [Kebab Factory](http://www.thekebabfactory.net/) going somewhat downhill in terms of quality, this is a good alternative.
