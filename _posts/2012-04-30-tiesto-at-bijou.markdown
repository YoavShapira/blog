This post is a bit delayed, but it was such an amazing event that I have to write about it.  
  
[Bijou](http://bijouboston.com/) is a relatively new night club / lounge in downtown Boston near [Chinatown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Boston).  It's a small venue, which makes it absolutely remarkable that they booked [**Tiesto**](http://www.tiesto.com/Tiesto-home), one of the all-time premier techno DJs in the world.

I hang out at turntable.fm's [Trance Out room](http://turntable.fm/trance_out) regularly.  Much of the crowd there is professional and semi-pro DJs.  Everyone was amazed that Tiesto, who fills out huge soccer stadiums in Europe and such, agreed to play such a small, intimate venue.  
  
Tickets were expensive, at $100 for the few minutes they were available, but were scalped for multiples of that figure outside the venue.  (I was just observing, not scalping, naturally.)

 (This is the transition from DJ Matos to Tiesto.)

  
This is on a Sunday night, too, before the start of the work week.  Tiesto had just finished his gigs at the [Winter Music Conference](http://wintermusicconference.com/) and was probably flying back home to the Netherlands.  
  
While waiting in the tiny admission line, I didn't hear a single word in English.  French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, German, and a couple of other languages, but no English, so that was amusing.

(Tiesto is playing is a remix of **[Steve Aoki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Aoki)**'s "Ladi Ladi," a great track.  Check [these](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sST9yUevUVQ) out too...)

  
**[DJ Matos](https://www.facebook.com/djmatos)** (of the [Vinyl Disciples](http://www.vinyldisciples.com/)) opened for Tiesto and did a great job.  I hadn't heard him live in a while, but he was great -- worth coming out for.  
  
I ran into a couple of friends spontaneously without coordinating in advance, and that always adds a lot of fun.  
  
But most importantly, the music was amazing.  Tiesto rocked the house at a very high energy level, playing a variety of new tracks from his upcoming Club Life 2 album, including remixes I'd never heard before.  There was one of remix **[Gotye](http://gotye.com/)**'s "[Somebody that I used to know](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UVNT4wvIGY)" track that I'm sure will be all over clubs all over the world this summer.

[Apparently](https://twitter.com/#!/tiesto/status/184286992610246657) Tiesto had a good time too:
