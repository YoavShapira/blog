Last Wednesday I cooked Alli a home-made dinner for her birthday ;)  So naturally, I chose wines to pair with it.  
  
I was looking forward to trying the [2004 Qupe Bien Nacido Hillside Estate syrah](http://www.qupe.com/Trade-Press/ArchiveWinePress.htm) from the Santa Maria valley.  Unfortunately, when I opened the bottle well in advance of dinner, it smelled dead ;(  I still decanted it for a solid hour to make sure, but it was dead beyond a doubt.  Too bad, as I would have liked to try it, especially after the assorted awards it won.

I went to my second choice, a [Molly Dooker 2007 "Two Left Feet."](http://www.mollydookerwines.com.au/index.cfm?method=storeproducts.showDrilldown&productid=67c4ef86-9397-3852-7bf4-4e52c73cab4d&CFID=7368509&CFTOKEN=fae4572ee6b65774-BC19099F-FBBC-FAAD-7EC7E4A36AC47DF2&jsessionid=4a3071438f698fd001f838531220563d3920)  This wine was awesome!  It's an unusual blend of syrah and "sparky Marquis" grapes.  The result is an unusual taste, with a huge, blunt front end but balanced on the back end with the lingering sophistication of a nice syrah.  It might be a little early to drink this wine, or maybe the front end will stay that bouncy for a while, I don't know.

Unfortunately that Molly Dooker is tough to get, not just here in the states, but everywhere I ask.  Limited production, sold out...  But I'd love to try it again.
