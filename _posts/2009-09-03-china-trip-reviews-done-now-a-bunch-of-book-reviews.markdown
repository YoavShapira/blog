Now that [my China trip posts](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/search/label/china) are done, it's time to review the books I've read during the past couple of weeks.  
  
As I [noted last month](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2009/08/product-review-amazon-kindle-dx.html), my new Amazon Kindle DX is awesome.  I love that thing.  I find myself reading more and faster, because it's easier and more convenient.  It was super valuable in China: long bus rides, long flights, reading outdoors, etc.  
  
If you don't care about my opinions on these books, you will want to speed-skip past the next handful of blog posts.
