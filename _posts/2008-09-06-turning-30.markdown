I turned 30 yesterday.  Thanks to all the well-wishers on [Facebook](http://www.new.facebook.com/people/Yoav_Shapira/711437), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/YoavShapira), Skype, [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/YoavShapira), good old emails, phone, and even the home-made BBQ sauce ;)  The long stream of congrats really made me feel nice.  
  
I don't feel too old.  Usually I don't even feel old.  Sometimes at night clubs, maybe, or when talking to some younger hipper colleagues ;)  The same colleagues also surprised me with a cake and singing at the [internet marketing authority](http://www.hubspot.com/), HubSpot, during the day yesterday.  Nicely done ;)
