Last Saturday night I saw the unusual theatre show, "[Green Eyes](http://www.companyone.org/Season13/Green_Eyes/greeneyes.shtml)," a Company One production, with a friend.  
  
The show is unusual partially because it takes place in a hotel suite (at the [Ames hotel](http://www.ameshotel.com/en-us/) downtown).  It's a short show, about an hour, with two actors, who are partially naked and arguing the whole time.  
  
Because of the location, there are only about 20 viewers, sitting in the same hotel suite.  It's a cozy situation, which is part of the fun.  
  
The acting was very good and convincing.  Most of the crowd was in shock at the end, and I think everyone enjoyed it.  I know I did.  
  
I like Company One because they have unusual productions.  I'm not a huge theatre fan, and I don't often go at all, much less to big mainstream shows.  But things like this are more engaging, more interesting.
