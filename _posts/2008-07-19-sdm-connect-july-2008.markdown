On Thursday evening I went to [MIT](http://web.mit.edu) to speak to some current [System Design and Management](http://sdm.mit.edu) (SDM) fellows.  This is the same graduate program I completed a couple of years ago, the same one I recommend to people with an engineering background who want to do more "management stuff."  
  
In fact, I blogged a little bit about the program, the classes, the curriculum, and more while I was a student.  You can find those blog posts right here with a simple search ;)  
  
SDM Connect is a semi-regular get-together, organized by [Jeremy](http://katzj.livejournal.com/) this year.  I always enjoy the opportunity to meet new SDM students (and new people in general), so this was a lot of fun.  
  
The conversation covered some of my personal background, my thoughts on some SDM courses a couple of years after graduating, some of the cool stuff we do at HubSpot, and more.  I had a good time, and hopefully some people found it useful.
