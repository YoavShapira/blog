My dad, who's a heart surgeon, is going to speak about how his hospital is a melting pot in the Middle East.  A relatively rare good, positive piece of news in that area ;)

  


The event is free and open to the public.  It's at the Harvard Kennedy School on Wednesday, January 27th, at 7pm.  Specifically, it's in the Belfer Center, 5th floor, Bell Hall.
