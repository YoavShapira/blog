Earlier this morning (too early: why, oh why, 8am??) I went to [an MITX event on User Experience](http://www.mitx.org/events/1789.cfm).  It's the first one in a new series on UX stuff, and I'm excited to have it.

  


I actually had fairly low expectations for the event, given the "UX 101" label.   But my expectations were surpassed, and I got some good nuggets of information / practice / or just for thought.  These include:

  


- Everyone thinks they're a designer.  They're not.  Ignore the noise.  Avoid the politics as much as you can.  (YS: easier said than done.)

  


- People don't like being surprised.  Put out a message in the UI when you change the UI.  (YS: don't let myself think this is clutter).

  


- The small things matter.  Make your error messages / error screens more usable.  (YS: often overlooked.  I'm guilty of this one, for sure).

  


- One participant has  been improving the same page for years, and still finds something "not quite right" with it each time he sees it.  (YS: don't aim for perfection, but for continuous improvement.  Still release early and often.)

  


- Ratio of designer to developer: average 1:5, often much worse.  (YS: one per Scrum team seems about right.)

  


- Contextual design is important.  Great example about how a "follow the user home" session resulted in unique findings not obtainable a different way, where the user had two browsers open at the same time.

  


- Look for the "5-tool players."  Those who can design and develop / produce much of their designs.  Avoid "Photoshop astronauts"  (my own term) who have no idea how to make their design actually render in a browser, or how hard it would be.

  


- It's far more common for developers who care about the UI to become these "devigners" than it is for the astronauts to become 5-tool players who can produce and develop.  ("Devigner" is a Dan A term, I think.)

  


I'll probably remember more take-aways later.  It was a good session, well worth attending.

  


By the way, [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com/company/careers/) is looking for such a devigner.  Think you can design a good UI and maybe hack it together?  Or know someone like that?  Let me know via comment here or an email:
