**Kathy Sierra** has [a (slightly) old blog post](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/how_to_host_a_p.html) describing how one might throw a product design party.  It's [an interesting post](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/how_to_host_a_p.html), worth reading, and a cool idea.

  


Have you ever done one of these?  If so, what did you think?  How did it work out?
