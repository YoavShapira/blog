As a developer myself, I have always been curious about how to motivate software developers, including myself ;)  Is it the project?  The technology?  The team you're working with?  The vision of the organization / company where you work?  Something else entirely?  
  
After some conversations with my colleagues at work, I wrote up a [blog article](http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/37762/How-To-AMP-Your-Engineers-Ideas-For-Energizing-Your-Best.aspx) on the topic.  I don't know if you'll find it interesting, but I hope you do.  I posted it on [OnStartups](http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/37762/How-To-AMP-Your-Engineers-Ideas-For-Energizing-Your-Best.aspx), one of the best entrepreneurship blogs I read, whose owner (**Dharmesh Shah**) is also my colleague at HubSpot and thus knows what we do inside and out.  
  
Check it out and let me know what you think, please.  Don't worry, I have a thick skin ;)
