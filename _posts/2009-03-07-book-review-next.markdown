This is another book I read on [my recent trip to Israel](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2009/03/israel-trip-february-2009.html).

  


[Next](http://www.amazon.com/Next-Michael-Crichton/dp/0060872985), by [Michael Crichton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton), is about genetic engineering, genomics, and its implications for law, medicine, entrepreneurship, and in general.

  


The book is well-written.  I like how everything comes together as the book progresses.  It starts with a half-dozen disparate story lines, and they all connect.  Cool.

  


The newspaper articles are a bit much at times, but it's not horrible.

  


Overall, a good read.  I really enjoyed it more and more as the book got going.
