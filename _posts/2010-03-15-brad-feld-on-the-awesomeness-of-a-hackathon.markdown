Good, short blog article from Brad Feld, a well-known VC, on hackathons.  Simple and to the point.  
  
"[The Awesomness of a Hackathon](http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2010/03/the-awesomeness-of-a-hackathon.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+FeldThoughts+(Feld+Thoughts))."  
  
It seems like relatively few Boston-area companies do hackathons.  Is it more of a West Coast thing?
