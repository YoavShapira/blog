The full title of **[Chelsea Handler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Handler)**'s book is [My Horizontal Life: A Collection of One-Night Stands](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582346186?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1582346186).![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=yoasspa-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1582346186)  
  
I got it on the recommendation of a friend, and it was pretty funny.

  


For me, the point of the book was to see things from a woman's perspective.  And of course, for sheer entertainment value.  The book certainly provided that.

  


The writing is clear, the stories simple and easy to follow, and the people, well, amusing as you might expect ;)  This was a good plane / beach / pass-the-time book.
