Last night [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com) and I met up with Ziv and Orit to see the movie [Slumdog Millionaire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048/).  It's the best movie I've seen this year, so I recommend you watch it in theatres while you can.

  


It's a really good story, told well, and with some amazing cinematography and camera work.  Ever since I read [Maximum City](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2007/09/book-reviews-maximum-city-and-one-l.html), I've wanted to see a visual illustration of the slums of Mumbai, and this certainly fit the bill.

  


There's some typical Bollywood drama, although the movie is more western in style, except for the typical dance scene as the credits roll at the end.  Decent acting, but really an amazing story.  Check it out.
