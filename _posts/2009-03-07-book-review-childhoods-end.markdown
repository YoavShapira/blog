On my [recent trip to Israel](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2009/03/israel-trip-february-2009.html), I had time to read a bunch of books.  This is a review of one of them.

  


[Childhood's End](http://www.amazon.com/Childhoods-End-Arthur-C-Clarke/dp/0345347951), by [Arthur C. Clarke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke), is a sci-fi classic.  I had heard about it, but not read it.  Then one of my co-workers (thanks, Mike!) brought it in to work a few weeks ago.  My interest was re-kindled.  He kindly let me borrow the book for the trip.

  


I loved this book.  It's highly recommended to all sci-fi fans.

  


Clarke's imagination truly knows no bounds.  The concepts, the context, the schemes are all as grand as anything you're likely to ever read.  It makes for captivating stories and the plane ride just flies by.  (No pun intended ;))
