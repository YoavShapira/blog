Every Thanksgiving **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com)** and I travel down to the gulf coast of Florida, where her parents and brothers live.  We celebrate Thanksgiving with them over a long weekend, and it's always a lot of fun.

  


This year, instead of staying with them in Sarasota, we all rented a big villa on [Captiva Island](http://images.google.com/images?rlz=1C1GGLS_en-USUS291US304&sourceid=chrome&q=captiva+island&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=5b4aS-6mMMjBlAeso5TyCQ&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4&ved=0CDQQsAQwAw).  This is an island / resort combination, about 1.5 hours south of [Sarasota](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasota,_Florida) (near [Fort Myers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Myers,_Florida)), still on the gulf coast of Florida.

  


The weather was beautiful, if a little windy at times.  But this wind brought some nice waves and opportunities for surfing, which some of us took advantage of.

  


The island is quiet, with not much to do.  A few little shops, a few little bars.  The [Mucky Duck](http://muckyduck.com/) was fun ;)

  


We flew out on Thursday morning, Thanksgiving morning, as we always do.  I love flying in this time window, as opposed to Thanksgiving eve.  There is hardly anyone at the airport or on the plane.  It's quiet and fun, the way I wish all flights could be.

  


Flying back on Sunday, the plane was full, but still not bad.  We took off and landed on time, got our bags quickly, and were home in short order.

  


Another fun Thanksgiving ;)  Looking forward to next year.
