_[The Secret Servant](http://danielsilvabooks.com/books/secret_servant.asp?id=desc)_ is a novel by **[Daniel Silva](http://danielsilvabooks.com/content/author.asp)**, one of my favorite authors for simple action / spy writing.  The book is easy to read, the story is interesting, and it makes for a great beach or airport accessory.

  


There's really not much to say beyond the above ;)  If you want to pass a couple of hours on the beach or in a plane and want something fun to read, _[The Secret Servant](http://danielsilvabooks.com/books/secret_servant.asp?id=desc)_ is a good candidate.  I have an affection for books related to Israeli security services in general.
