Almost four months ago, back in May, I [left](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2012/05/im-going-to-travel-bit-rtw2012.html) on a round-the-world (rtw) trip. I landed back in the US a couple of days ago, and have been struggling a bit with writer's block since. I have so much share, it's hard to know where to start. Also, I much needed to catch up on sleep, laundry, and other things.  
  
This post, my first since I came back, is a short summary. It's part of the [#rtw2012 series](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/search/label/rtw2012), which you may want to read chronologically.  
  
Overall, this trip is one of the best things I've ever done for myself. I feel lucky and blessed to have had the opportunity to do it. I know most people never do.  
  
I hope and wish all my friends each have a similar opportunity to do their own trip, according to their own interests, preferences, and timelines. I would be glad to help any of y'all plan it, and support you as you go along. Do it, you won't regret it.

I'm glad I took advantage of this opportunity when it became available. Although a lot of people have similar dreams, many back down when actually presented with the chance. It's complicated to plan, it's challenging to execute well, it's a little scary (especially traveling by yourself). I hope these posts, which will go into a lot of logistical details, help other folks planning their own trips in the future.  
  
The world is an amazing place if you come to it open-minded, without a lot of assumptions or stereotypes, relaxed, and respectful. Nearly everyone I met, and there were many folks, was friendly, helpful, interested, and interesting, if you just take the time to know them.  
  
It goes without saying that the world is also full of interesting places, both historical and new, indoors and outdoors, all sorts of places. You can never see them all, and that's not the goal. I learned a lot on this trip.  
  
I want to thank all my friends and family for the support. Everyone was encouraging in terms of "take this trip, do it for longer than you want, extend it, do more, and take notes / pictures to share when you return." That was great.  
  
Another thanks / shout out goes to my downstairs neighbors Danielle and Dave, who took care of my place while I was away, particularly watering my one plant, Jim.

Finally, a thanks to all the hosts who had me over, both the paid (Airbnb -- lots more details on that in a separate post) and especially the unpaid one. I hope I was an alright guest :)  
  
The following posts in this series will be thematic, each centered on a particular city / country, or a theme like electronics, street food, cocktails bars, not looking like a tourist, etc.
