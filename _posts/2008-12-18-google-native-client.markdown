Whoa!  I just read this article on [Info World](http://weblog.infoworld.com/fatalexception/archives/2008/12/native_client_g.html), and got a few emails about it within the past few minutes.  
  
Apparently Google has a [Native Client](http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/) to run code in a browser that has access to raw hardware.  That's just cool from a computer science perspective.  If it really lets you run a lot of code and the performance is really there.  
  
Maybe the snowstorm this weekend will give me a chance to play with this...
