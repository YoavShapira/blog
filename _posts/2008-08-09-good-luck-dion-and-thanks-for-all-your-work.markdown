Today I found a fellow Apache Software Foundation committer has a bit of a health issue that he's tackling head-on.  You probably don't know [dIon Gillard](http://www.multitask.com.au/people/dion/archives/000621.html) personally, and neither do I, but if you read this blog it's pretty likely you've used [dIon's work](http://www.google.com/codesearch?q=dion+gillard&hl=en&btnG=Search+Code) and benefited from [his numerous open-source contributions](http://www.google.com/codesearch?q=dion+gillard&hl=en&btnG=Search+Code).  
  
Good luck [dIon](http://www.multitask.com.au/people/dion/)!
