Last night **[Alli ](http://allisonshapira.com/)**and I saw the movie _[Unknown](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1401152/)_ with my cousin **Jonathan** and his wife **Hanni**.  It was a decent movie, not bad at all, with some good action sequences and fun scenes.

It's not the most creative movie ever written.  There are elements which are very similar to the [Bourne trilogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_Trilogy) (which I liked a lot, much more so in book form than movie form), and even some things similar to an earlier **[Liam Neeson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Neeson)** movie I liked, _[Taken](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0936501/)_.

Unknown is not as good as the above films, but it's still fun to watch, if a bit mindless.
