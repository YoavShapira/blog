The final piece of this blog series, just a few assorted notes, mostly for my own records.

  


[Rijksmuseum](http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/): awesome, just as advertised.  Some awe-inspiring masterpieces.  A few paintings that look more lifelike than my pictures.  I'm not a good photographer, but still.  Wow.

  


[Van Gogh](http://www3.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?lang=nl) museum: impressive collection, well-organized, but I'm jut not a big fan of Van Gogh's style.  Of course I'm clueless in arts, but his work just doesn't captivate me.

  


[Trains and trams](http://www.gvb.nl/english/Pages/default.aspx): absolutely a joy to ride and use.  We used them a lot, and I would do so again with no hesitation.  Get the multi-day all-you-can-eat pass, it's worth it.

  


[Amsterdam Centraal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_Centraal_railway_station): great train station.  Organized, clean, big, easy to find what you want, very nice.

  


Amsterdam airport ([Schiphol](http://www.schiphol.com/)): again, very nice.  Love the train station right there in the airport.  Convenient, good shopping options, efficient service.

  


[Red Light District](http://www.amsterdam.info/red-light-district/): entertaining, fun to walk through once.  Interesting cultural observations.

  


[Haven de Texel](http://www.havenvantexel.nl/): good local restaurant serving Dutch specialties from Texel.  Just OK, not highly recommended, but certainly not bad.

  


[Canal bus](http://www.canal.nl/ne/index.php): touristy, but a good perspective for an hour or so.  Next time I might try the Canal Bike.

  


[Jewish Historical museum](http://www.jhm.nl/english.aspx): under-rated, very interesting.  Really well laid-out, thoughtfully organized.  Worth the two hours to walk there and visit.

  


[Anne Frank](http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?pid=1&lid=2)[ house](http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?pid=1&lid=2): interesting, definitely worth visiting.  Come after 5pm to avoid a 30minutes+ line.

  


[Flea market](http://www.amsterdam.info/markets/waterlooplein/): not bad, but nothing special.

  


[Flower market](http://www.amsterdam.info/shopping/flowermarket/): cool, but I'm not into flowers.  Still worth walking around once.

  


Fries with mayo at [Vleminckx](http://www.hiptravelguides.com/modules.php?name=Reviews&rop=showcontent&site=1&rid=205): really good, worth the 5-minute wait in line.  They close at 6pm, but don't wait until the last minute because they often run out of fries.  We got lucky, and savored every bit.

  


Duration: a long weekend (4-5 days) is perfect to see and enjoy the city.  More is needed if you want to also enjoy the countryside.

  


Next time: maybe stay at the [Dylan](http://www.dylanamsterdam.com/), and have dinner at [Supper Club](http://www.supperclub.com/).
