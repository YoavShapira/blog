Earlier today **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I went to [Nahant Beach](http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/lynnshores.htm), up in Boston's [North Shore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Shore_(Massachusetts)), in the town of [Nahant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahant,_Massachusetts).  We had a blast!

  


Nahant is a gorgeous, really long (several miles, it seemed) beach.  The sand is fine, there is usually a nice breeze, and there is plenty (plenty!) of public parking for $3.  That's hard to beat.

  


There are also a handful of clam shacks and other restaurants nearby.  We had a great lobster roll at the Red Rock Cafe after hanging out at the beach for a couple of hours.  This casual place is about 10 minutes driving from the beach, not right there, but worth the trip.

  


It was a beautiful day.  I want to go back to Nahant Beach, and hopefully we'll have time for it this summer.
