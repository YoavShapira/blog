I [wrote about KO Prime](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2007/08/restaurant-review-ko-prime.html) two years ago, shortly after it had opened to the public.  It's a great modern steak house in the [Nine Zero](http://www.ninezero.com/) boutique hotel downtown.

  


Last week I went again with a group of colleagues, and we had a blast.  Or at least, I did ;)

  


I don't remember every single detail.  But the food and wine were both excellent, and of course the company was exceptional.  Service was very good, not amazing.  The wine list is decent, containing a broad selection, but mostly priced way up.

  


Nonetheless, we enjoyed some nice Spanish cava and a couple of great Italian reds.  They went very well with the steaks.

  


Overall, the prices are high.  This is definitely an expensive place, a treat for special occassions.  But it's a very good candidate for that.  Especially for people, like me, who are a little bit tired of the plain traditional steakhouses.
