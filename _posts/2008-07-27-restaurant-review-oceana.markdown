On Friday night, [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com) and I had dinner at [Oceana](http://marriottmodules.com/restaurant/hotels/hotel-information/travel/boslw-boston-marriott-long-wharf/oceana).  Oceana is the main restaurant of the [Marriott Long Wharf](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/boslw-boston-marriott-long-wharf/) hotel, which is on the water front near the [Aquarium](http://www.neaq.org/index.php).  It's an area that we like a lot all year, but especially in the summer.  It's full of people hanging out at places like [Tia's](http://www.tiaswaterfront.com/) and [The Landing](http://www.bostonharborcruises.com/the-landing-at-long-wharf.aspx), walking around the water front, and enjoying the post-[Big Dig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig_%28Boston%2C_Massachusetts%29) open park spaces.  
  
The restaurant itself was pretty good.  It's a big space and it was almost empty, which is not a good sign.  The emphasis, as the name and the location suggest, is on seafood.  I had some crab-crusted cod, and Alli had some scallops.  Both were good.  But the surprise dish was the [lobster bisque](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/lobster-bisque-recipe/index.html) soup, which was among the best we've ever had in that vein.  
  
The pleasant surprise was the wine I chose to complement the meal, a [2006 Casa Lapostolle Sauvignon Blanc](http://www.liquorama.net/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=17947).  It's a fairly cheap wine, but proved a great match to the food and truly a joy to sip.  Highly recommended, that one, for these hot summer days.  
  
Overall, Oceana is decent.  They have a nice terrace, too, which serves a simpler bar menu.  The service was good, the location is great, and the food very good as well.
