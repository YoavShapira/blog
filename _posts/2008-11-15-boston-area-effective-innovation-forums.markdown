[This](http://www.innoeco.com/2008/11/bostons-biggest-trade-associations.html) is a great list of people who are "getting it done right," from [Scott Kirsner](http://www.scottkirsner.com/) of the Innovation Economy blog: "[Boston's Biggest Trade Associations Flunk the Student Test](http://www.innoeco.com/2008/11/bostons-biggest-trade-associations.html)". Â [The blog itself](http://www.innoeco.com/2008/11/bostons-biggest-trade-associations.html) is very good and well worth reading.
