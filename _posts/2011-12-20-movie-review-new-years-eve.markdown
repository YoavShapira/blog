This past weekend I saw the movie _[New Year's Eve](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598822/)_.  I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, even though it's not an original idea (see _[Love Actually](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314331/)_, _[Valentine's Day](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0817230/)_, and more...)

The cast is great, and the setting (New Year's Eve in [Times Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square) in New York City) is fun as well.  It's not the best plot or movie of all time, but it's fun to watch.  It's particularly fun for me since that's where I'm going to be in ~2 weeks myself, in person ;)  Look for me in the bright red mountaineering parka...
