I love this little place in the South End, [Coppa](http://www.coppaboston.com/), but I hadn't been there in a couple of years ([first review](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2010/01/restaurant-review-coppa.html)).  It's tiny, usually impossible to get a seat, and parking is a challenge as well.  But it's so worth it ;)

I went with a friend last week, on a week night, without a reservation, just because we were in the area.  We were lucky and got the last two available seats at the bar.  
  
We ordered a variety of small plates, and everything was great.  The tuna crudo (pictured above) and the vegetables (!) stuck out in my mind as exceptional.  Specifically, the Cavolfiore (Marinated cauliflower with shallots, thyme, Ricotta Salata and sea salt) and wood-roasted Brussels sprouts with horseradish and pecorino were amazing.  
  
This is probably the first time on this blog that I single out vegetables in a particular menu, but these were worth it.  
  
The drinks, atmosphere, service, and prices are all very good.  Highly recommended.
