Last Sunday I had dim-sum with a few friends to celebrate Thai and Clara's anniversary.  We went to [Hei La Moon](http://www.hiddenboston.com/HeiLaMoon.html) and had a good time.  We usually go to [China Pearl](http://www.chinapearlrestaurant.com/) for dim-sum, but we wanted to try out a new place.

  


Hei La Moon was very good.  The spring rolls were better than China Pearl, and the rest of the details were about the same as China Pearl.  I enjoy both places about equally and recommend them both.
