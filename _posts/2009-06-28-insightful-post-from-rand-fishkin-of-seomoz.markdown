**Rand Fishkin**, the founder and CEO of [SEOmoz](http://www.seomoz.org), just wrote a [very insightful blog post](http://www.seomoz.org/blog/my-startup-experience-vc-entrepreneurship-selfanalysis-the-road-ahead) about their process through funding decisions, execution, metrics, and vision changes.  It's worth reading in its entirety.  The transparency and honesty are refreshing.  Well done, Rand, and thanks!
