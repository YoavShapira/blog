One highlight of the [SDM conference](http://sdm.mit.edu/conf08) each year is the alumni dinner.  It took place last night at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Cambridge.  I like that location: beautiful view, good space, good food, good service.  Plus a bar right there, which served us well later in the night.

  


It's a nice, mostly unstructured networking event.  Food is available the whole time, which is great.  Most networking events have a limited food period, which causes bursts of getting food, lines, waits, etc.

  


One of the few structured parts is the presentation of the annual SDM Alumni Thesis award.  This is a contest where alumni judge last year's theses on criteria like originality and significance.  I've been a judge for a little while, and I enjoy reading all the research work.  This year's was a great batch, and congrats again to the winner, David Kim.

  


It's always great to see a bunch of fellow alumni, current students, and meet some new folks.  We had a record high attendance, so I don't think I got to talk to everyone.  But I had a blast, and I think others did too.

  


After the official event ended, a few of us hung out at the hotel bar, which was a lot of fun as well.  It's just a great event, I wouldn't change it in any way.
