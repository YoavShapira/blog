On April 20th I went to the [Red Sox](http://www.redsox.com/) - Yankees baseball game, which was also celebrating [the 100th anniversary of Fenway Park](http://mlb.mlb.com/bos/fenwaypark100/index.jsp).

It was a beautiful sunny spring day, a great afternoon to spend with some new friends.  
  
The pre-game ceremony was amazing, featuring 200+ of past Red Sox players coming out to the field, taking their positions, and hanging out.  There was a fighter plane flyover, a couple of short readings from the announcer, a special huge flag hanging over the monster, music, books, and more.  And a lot of cheering from the crowd.

A few other friends (e.g. **[Dan](https://twitter.com/#!/dunster)** and **[Matt](https://twitter.com/#!/mattschnitt)**) were also at the game, and it was fun to meet up with them briefly to say hi.  
  
Unfortunately the Red Sox lost :(  But it was still a beautiful and memorable Friday afternoon at the ball park.
