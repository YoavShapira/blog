It's that time of year.  Should I renew my [ACM](http://www.acm.org/) membership?

  


I just renewed my [IEEE](http://www.ieee.org/) membership, including the [Computer Society](http://www.computer.org/) portion.

  


[Communications of the ACM](http://cacm.acm.org/) (CACM) is an awesome journal, but I haven't really been reading it for a while.  I find much of the same content online in various blogs and other repositories.  Not all, but much.

  


So what do you think?  Help me decide.
