This past weekend, as part of our fifth anniversary celebrations, [**Alli**](http://allisonshapira.com/) and I jointly took a [rock climbing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_climbing) 101 class. We had an awesome time!  
  
I was into rock climbing very briefly about 11 years ago.  I stopped because I did not have a partner, and I only did top-roping, which requires a partner, at the time.  
  
We took the class at [Metro Rock](http://www.metrorock.com/), which is an indoor climbing gym on Boston's north shore,  in [Everett](http://www.ci.everett.ma.us/).  We had a fantastic time, our instructor **Dan** was awesome, and we look forward to climbing more in the future.  
  
I'm now looking for some rock climbing gear, especially a [harness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_climbing_equipment) and shoes.  Any recommendations?
