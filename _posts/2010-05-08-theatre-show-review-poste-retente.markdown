Last night **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I went to a wonderful modern theatre show, [Poste Retente](http://calendar.boston.com/boston-ma/events/show/106747565-poste-restante).  It took place in the [Charlestown Working Theatre](http://www.charlestownworkingtheater.org/), and you should definitely go if you're in Boston today (Saturday).  If not, you also have a chance to catch the show in NYC  and Prague in the upcoming months.  
  
The show is a mix of acrobatics, theatre, dance, and a couple of other forms of performance.  It's just great to watch and highly entertaining.  **Tim** and **Bonnie** ("[They Gotta Be Secret Agents](http://www.the-secret-agents.com/index.html)") do an awesome job, the setting is great, and the whole thing is just highly recommended.
