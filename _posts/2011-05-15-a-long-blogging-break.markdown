... it looks like I haven't blogged in about six weeks, my longest break in a while.  Wow!  Time flies when you're having fun, I guess ;)

It's been busy at work and busy with life.  Nothing crazy, no major news.  Work at [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com/) is cranking, and our new Platform team is making nice progress.   At home we've done a bit of traveling, a bunch of cooking and eating out, and generally had fun.  
  
I've actually blogged a couple of times on the [HubSpot dev blog](http://dev.hubspot.com/), but that's no excuse to stop here.  I'll try to catch up a bit.  
  
By the way, it looks like blogger has some cool new dynamic views for this (and other) blogs: [Flipcard](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/view/flipcard), [Mosaic](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/view/mosaic), [Sidebar](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/view/sidebar), [Snapshot](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/view/snapshot), [Timeslide](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/view/timeslide).
