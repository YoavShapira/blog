I expected _[Tower Heist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0471042/)_ to be mediocre, just a way to mindlessly laugh at some stupid jokes.  And it provided that, but it ended up being smarter, funnier, and trickier than expected.  At points, it seemed like a parody of the Ocean trilogy (which I love), but done in a self-deprecating manner.

Either way, there were a large number of super funny moments and scenes.  Better than expected.
