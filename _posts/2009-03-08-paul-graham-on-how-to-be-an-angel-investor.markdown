I don't normally re-syndicate [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/)'s essays, since almost everyone who reads this blog reads his blog already.  And while I generally like his writing a lot, I hardly ever get such an "a-ha" moment that  I can't resist a blog post.

  


But his latest essay, on [how to be an angel investor](http://www.paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html), hits me at a particularly good time.  A few friends and myself have been thinking about this for a while.  The economy helps push the thought further along.  And Paul's column is insightful and clear.  Definitely worth reading.
