In September, **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I traveled to Israel to visit my family as we do every year, as well as celebrate a cousin's wedding (congrats, **Jonathan**!), meet friends, and generally relax.  It was an awesome trip.  
  
For my parents' anniversary earlier this year, the kids (my two sisters, my brother in law **[Doron](http://www.facebook.com/DoronLehmann)**, and us) bought my parents a coffee machine.  My parents love coffee and go out for coffee often.  I myself am not a big drinker, but I don't mind it at all.  
  
Doron did most of the research and ended up choosing a [Nespresso Citiz and Milk](http://www.nespresso.com/citiz/) (D120 is the model name) machine.  I didn't actually see or use the machine until this trip to Israel.  But on the trip, we had at least one coffee a day from this machine, and ended up loving it.

We usually drink a cappuccino in the morning, not an espresso, but we do like the variety sometimes.  And we love the options of different coffees.  But most of all, the machine was really easy to use and really easy to clean. You got a get coffee from it every time in 60 seconds.   
  
It was good enough, in fact, that we bought one for ourselves on our return to Boston.  They sell them online at Nespresso.com, at Crate & Barrel stores in the Boston area (although they don't always have this specific model), and at the new Nespresso boutique store on Newbury Street.  
  
The machine still rocks.  The coffee is awesome.  But perhaps the most important aspect to me is a sort of spiritual connection with my family back in Israel.  I know my mom, and likely other family members, are having the same coffee the same way every day.  It's a small thing, but meaningful for me. ;)  
  
Oh, and if you're curious, we ordered more Arpeggio, Capriccio, and Volluto after the initial tasting.  We'll see which emerges as the favorite the next time around.
