I had this stellar red wine, the [2004 Argiano Solengo](http://www.wine.com/V6/Argiano-Solengo-2004/wine/94170/detail.aspx), about 4 months ago.  The bottle was waiting, empty, in the wine rack, for me to either blog about or buy more.  I'm going to do both.

  


At the time, I got the wine for a reasonable price.  Now it's nearing theoretical full maturity, so its pricing is rising.  Nonetheless, even at $85 or $100, it may be a good deal.  You won't find it for less than $300 now in a restaurant, and $500 by 2012 when it's fully mature.

  


As for an actual description, I'll defer to the [Wine Enthusiast](http://www.wine.com/V6/Argiano-Solengo-2004/wine/94170/detail.aspx): 

<blockquote>The 2004 Solengo presents gorgeous aromatics followed by super-ripe dark fruit, crushed flowers, herbs, spices and sweet toasted oak that flow from its opulent, full-bodied frame. Showing superb concentration, the wine is supported by an attractive note of underlying minerality that provides balance as well as a sense of proportion. It offers outstanding length, a silky-textured personality and ripe, sweet tannins on the finish in a rare display that marries power with elegance. It will be tempting to drink this early, but a few years of cellaring will give the wine an opportunity to express the fullest range of its potential.</blockquote>
