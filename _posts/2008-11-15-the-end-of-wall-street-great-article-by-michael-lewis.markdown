On [Portfolio.com](http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/11/11/The-End-of-Wall-Streets-Boom#page1), [Michael Lewis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lewis_(author)) (author of [Liar's Poker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar's_Poker), which I really liked) has written a fantastic article titled "[The End of Wall Street](http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/11/11/The-End-of-Wall-Streets-Boom#page1)."  It's long, but well-worth reading.  Check out this quote:  
  


<blockquote>He called Standard & Poor’s and asked what would happen to default rates if real estate prices fell. The man at S&P couldn’t say; its model for home prices had no ability to accept a negative number.</blockquote>

(My bolding.)
