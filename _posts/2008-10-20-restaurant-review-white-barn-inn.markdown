As noted earlier, [we went to Kennebunkport this past weekend](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2008/10/one-night-in-kennebunkport.html).  I'd been wanting to go to the [White Barn Inn restaurant](http://www.whitebarninn.com/Content_Common/pg-kennebunkport-maine-restaurants-fine-dining.seo) for years now, so this was a nice chance to do so.

  


The restaurant was excellent.  The setting is a beautiful converted barn, really nicely decorated.  There is a pianist, which is always a nice touch.

  


The food was delicious.  One of the most interesting entrees on the tasting menu was a braised veal cheek with parsnip gnocchi, sage, and brown butter.  Super.

  


Service was consistently very good and friendly.   The wine matching for the tasting menu was very good, though not amazing.  The server's knowledge of wine was just OK, and their knowledge of the menu was very good but not excellent.  They missed what I thought were a few obvious points, but they made up for it with friendliness, timeliness, and effort.

  


Overall the White Barn Inn is a good place to go.  It's expensive, probably more so than it's worth.  It's very romantic, and in fact was my favorite thing in Kennebunkport.  That said, I'm unlikely to go there again, unless I happen to be in the area and have a special occasion to celebrate.
