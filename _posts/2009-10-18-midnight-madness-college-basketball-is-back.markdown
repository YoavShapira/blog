My favorite college sport in the US got started this weekend, with the traditional Midnight Madness celebrations.  [ESPN has a good intro video](http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=4568052), and [YouTube has plenty more](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=midnight+madness&search_type=&aq=f).

  


I also like college football, but the broken playoff system is so annoying, I don't watch much.  College basketball, on the other hand, absolutely has it nailed with the March Madness tournament.  My dad and I go to the Final Four each year, and it's always one of the best weekends of the whole year.
