Last night I watched the movie [Knowing](http://knowing-themovie.com/) with [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com), her parents, and her brother.  It was a good movie for most of the time, but I didn't like the ending.

  


I like movies that straddle the bounary between realistic and sci-fi / paranormal.  Like the [X-Files](http://www.xfiles.com/) or [Signs](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286106/).  You know there's something out there, but you don't know what, you don't see it.  It's not cheesy.

  


Knowing walked a fine line for 75% of the movie, and then it [jumped the shark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark).  The ending, except for some spectacular visual effects, came apart.

  


Oh well ;)  It's a decent rental.
