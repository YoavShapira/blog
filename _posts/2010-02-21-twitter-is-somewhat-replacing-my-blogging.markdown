... not completely, but somewhat.  I'm more active on Twitter now, and finding it fun.   
  
Maybe it's a time-constraint thing: I don't have the time to write a lot of blog posts, but I do have a lot of quick observations, links to share, etc.  
  
Maybe that's just a laziness-oriented excuse, but hopefully not ;)  I really have been enjoying Twitter, and its interactions, more.  [Echofon](http://echofon.com/) helps.

  


Nonetheless, I do have some restaurant, hotel, trip, movie, and product reviews to write here.  As well as a couple of longer pieces, possibly.
