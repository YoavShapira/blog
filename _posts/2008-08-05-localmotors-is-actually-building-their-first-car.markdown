When [LocalMotors](http://www.local-motors.com) was just an idea on paper, a lot of people never thought the company would really build a car based on a community design concept.  Today represents another step in the process towards that idea.  The [first community design](http://www.local-motors.com/buildProcess.php) has been voted upon, chosen, and LocalMotors has committed to building it.  Check out Sangho Kim's [LM Rally Fighter](http://www.local-motors.com/buildProcess.php)!  
  
So cool.
