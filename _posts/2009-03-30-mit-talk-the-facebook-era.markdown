Earlier today I went over to an [MIT Sloan](http://www.insidefacebook.com/2007/10/21/interview-with-clara-shih-co-creator-of-faceforce/) Marketing Club event.  It was a talk by [Clara Shih](http://www.insidefacebook.com/2007/10/21/interview-with-clara-shih-co-creator-of-faceforce/), author of [The Facebook Era](http://www.facebook.com/thefacebookera) (which is available to the public as of today).  The talk was about some of the changes social networking brings to sales and marketing.  It's a topic near and dear to our hearts here at HubSpot.

  


Clara made some interesting points about [hypertargeting for ads](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/myspace_launching_hypertargeting_ads.php), the trust we put in online identities, and about transitive trust.  I trust you because you're friends with X, whom I know, etc.

  


She was a good speaker, and had plenty of good examples.  The lecture hall (E51-325) was packed, and I'm glad I went.
