I've been trying to read more books this year, at the expense of TV and magazine subscriptions, and it's mostly worked.  A couple of weeks ago I finished an awesome book: "[The Big Short](http://www.amazon.com/Big-Short-Inside-Doomsday-Machine/dp/0393072231?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=yoasspa-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=0393072231)" by **[Michael Lewis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lewis_(author))**.

Lewis is also the author of the classic "[Liar's Poker](http://www.amazon.com/Liars-Poker-Michael-Lewis/dp/039333869X?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=yoasspa-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=039333869X)" and "[Moneyball](http://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=yoasspa-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=0393324818)", which I've written about in the past.  I love both books.  Maybe his writing style is a bit verbose, but I find it clear and engaging.  Even the verbose parts tend to be about repeating the technical or intricate pieces of the story, so that's OK.  
  
I don't want to ruin the book for anyone reading this blog.  It explains some of the reasons for the recent financial crisis extremely well, and it's easy to read.  Highly recommended.
