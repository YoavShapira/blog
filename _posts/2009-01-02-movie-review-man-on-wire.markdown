Last night [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com) and I watched [Man on Wire](http://manonwire.com/), an amazing movie documentary.  It chronicles the story of [Philippe Petit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Petit), a French tightrope walker who walked between the World Trade Center towers, from roof to roof.

  


The movie shows how they pulled together this stunt, and others previously, such as in Sydney and in Paris.  It's well-told and riveting.  It's also inspiring in just how dedicated (crazy?  insane?) Philippe is to his art.  We debated the sanity question for a long time after the movie.

  


Well worth watching.  Apparently it also want a bunch of awards at [Sundance](http://festival.sundance.org/2009/).
