Last Tuesday night [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com) and I had dinner at [La Campania](http://www.lacampania.com/), an Italian restaurant in [Waltham](http://www.city.waltham.ma.us/).  We had a few friends rave about the place, so we wanted to check it out.

  


It was very good experience, though a bit unexpected.  The unexpected part was that the pasta dishes were just OK, but the rest of the food was delicious.  Specifically, my braised veal chop was among the best I've ever had.  But the cinghiale ([wild boar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar)) ragu pasta disappointed, not even close to the offerings of practically the same dish at [Prezza](http://www.prezza.com/) or [Via Matta](http://www.viamattarestaurant.com/index_flash.htmv).  And the desserts were blah.

  


The wine list is brilliant and the sommelier was very helpful.  Service in general was very good.  The wine list has a great selection with fairly good pricing.  We had a bottle of [2004 Argiano Solengo](http://winelibrary.com/reviewwine.asp?item=33669), a "[Super Tuscan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_wine#Super_Tuscans)" that is unusual for its blend of Cab, Merlot, and Syrah grapes.  It's a bit premature now, but it's a fascinating and really fun to drink.

  


Overall, La Campania was fun, and the food was good, but it's not worth the trip from [Boston](http://www.boston.com) to Waltham.  If I were in the area or lived there or something, I'd go back, but otherwise, there are plenty of amazing Italian place in town.
