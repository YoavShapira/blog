Last night [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com) and I met a couple of [Kennedy School](http://www.hks.harvard.edu) friends at [Great Scott](http://www.greatscottboston.com/) to see [Elisa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisa_Toffoli) perform.  Elisa is an Italian pop singer, and we like her music.  

  


The concert was fun.  I'm not usually a fan of live music that much.  It's not bad, but it's just not my thing.  However, having a tiny venue where you can see the singer up close makes a big difference.

  


The only down side was that Elisa is promoting her new English language album, [Dancing](http://www.amazon.com/Dancing-Elisa/dp/B001AZ8BOQ), so she sang mostly in Enligsh.  I was hoping for more Italian ;(
