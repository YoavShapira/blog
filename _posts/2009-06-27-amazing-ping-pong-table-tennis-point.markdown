We've been playing a bit of [ping pong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis) (table tennis) at HubSpot recently, since we got the new table in our game room.  While there are many players better than me, I still enjoy the game.  And I think I've been getting a little better over time, which helps my enthusiasm.

  


Earlier today I was looking on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8IVASo0umU) for some other stuff, when I stumbled across this cool video.  It shows one point from a table tennis match, but it's an impressive point.  Check it out on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8IVASo0umU) or below.
