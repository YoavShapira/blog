Also last weekend, after [our dinner at Om](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2009/12/restaurant-review-om-again.html), we went to the [Harvard Kennedy School](http://www.hks.harvard.edu/) (HKS) winter formal, 2009 edition.

  


This party was a lot of fun.  Great people, great location ([Harvard Faculty Club](http://www.hfc.harvard.edu/)), great music.

  


I don't always enjoy dressing up, and I don't like tuxes, but this was fine.

  


The [Harvard Faculty Club](http://www.hfc.harvard.edu/) is a cool place to host these events, because it has several rooms, not one enormous ballroom.  So each room can have its own personality and feel.  There are quieter areas and louder areas, sit-down areas, and multiple bars.  That worked out really well.

  


Hanging out with **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com)**'s MPA classmates is always a blast.  They are wonderfully diverse and thoughtful.  Add a little bit of dancing, a little bit of drinking (mostly Diet Coke for me that night, after Om...), and you have a good recipe.
