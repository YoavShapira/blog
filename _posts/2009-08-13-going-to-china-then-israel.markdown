Tomorrow, **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com)** and I are flying to China!  We're very excited about this trip.  Neither of us has ever been to Asia at all, and we now have a great opportunity to go, since one of our good friends is getting married in Shanghai.

  


What's more, we're going with a group of friends and we'll know locals on the ground, via the groom's family.  This blog post is mostly to let people know I'll be truly and completely off-line for the next two or so weeks.  I also wanted to share some itinerary details.

  


In Shanghai 8/14-816, staying at The Bund Riverside Hotel.  The Bund, French Concession, Nanjing Road, Actobat shows, Renmin Square, Yu Yuan Gardens, etc.

  


In Hangzhou 8/16-8/17: West Lake, Silk Market, tea plantations, etc.

  


In Huangshan 8/18-8/20: Yellow Mountain, Summit of Brightness, Dropped Rock, mucho hiking, overnight at Shilin Hotel at the top of the peak.

  


In Kunshan 8/21-8/22, for our friend's wedding and local stuff: Suzhou, Qipao shopping, Tiger Hill, etc.

  


8/23-8/24: Xi'an, Terracotta Warriors, Big Wild Goose pagoda, Tang Dynasty Music Show, dumpling banquet.

  


8/24-8/28: Beijing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Summer Palace, Ming toms, Tiananmen Square, Template of Heaven, Pearl Market, Hutongs, etc.

  


After that I'm flying to Israel, getting there at the end of August.  I'll be back online once in Israel, after recovering from my jet lag ;)

  


I'll be in in Israel with my family, working and online, for a couple of weeks.  My sister is getting married on 9/15, and after that it's back to Boston.  I will have finally completed my wish of flying around the world, literally ;)

  


I'll also be in Israel on September 5th, my birthday, and September 18th, the Jewish new year (Rosh Hashana).

  


Safe travels to all ;)
