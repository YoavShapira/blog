Last night **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com)** and I watched tho movies: _[The Hangover](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1119646/)_, and _[The Taking of Pelham 123](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1111422/)_.

  


_[The Hangover](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1119646/)_ was pretty good and funny, although not as good as _[Old School](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0302886/)_ or _[Superbad](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0829482/)_.  I like stupid-humor comedies, so The Hangover fit that bill.  A few moments were very funny, but for the most part the movie was just OK.

  


Then our drinks buddies bailed out, and since we were already in the theatre, we saw another movie.  _[The Taking of Pelham 123](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1111422/)_ is a fairly simple action movie, nothing crazy.  It, too, was pretty good but not amazing.  I had higher hopes for this move than I did for The Hangover, so it was a little disappointing.

  


All in all, a fun night at the movies.  Nothing amazing, but not bad either.
