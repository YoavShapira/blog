[The Recruit](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0292506/) is not a new movie, but I saw it for the first time this past weekend.  It's pretty good: intruiging story, well-known actors.  It's not entirely surprising or unpredictable, but fairly entertaining.  Worth a rental, which we did.

  


Also this weekend, I read [The Cloud Garden](http://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Garden-Adventure-Survival-Horticulture/dp/1592284302):  A True Story of Adventure, Survival, and Extreme Horticulture.  I got this book for my birthday a couple of months ago, and it's really good.  It's a fascinating story about a remote, lawless area: The Darien Gap.  Well worth reading.
