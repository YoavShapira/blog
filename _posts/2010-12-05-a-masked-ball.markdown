Last night **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I went to the Harvard masked / masquerade ball.  It took place at the [Harvard Club](http://www.harvardclub.com/Club/Scripts/Home/home.asp) and it was a lot of fun.  It's basically a fancy-ish party ([black tie optional](http://fashion.about.com/cs/glossary/a/partydefinition.htm)) where people also wear masks.  Not a big deal, really, but it does add a fun dimension since you can't read people's faces as well.  
  
The music was good when the DJ played.  There were also occasional other acts and performances.  Alli sang a song from _[The Phantom of the Opera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera)_, and of course that was beautiful ;)  
  
There was a nice dessert bar with a chocolate fountain, among other treats, and a decent bar selection.  We knew a few folks, not a lot, and met a couple with some striking similarities to us, quite by coincidence.  
  
Overall, it was a lot of fun.  And it was nothing like the _[Eyes Wide Shut](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120663/)_ movie masked evening, seen below.
