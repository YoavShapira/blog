The past couple of months, partially thanks to a new friend, I've been listening a little less to my usual techno + trance work (although [I didn't fully stop](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2012/04/tiesto-at-bijou.html) ;)), and a little more to some alt + indie work.  It's been fun.  


  


I wanted to share some of my favorites from recent months, if only for my own amusing recollection years from now.  This is not a complete list, just the top few from my Spotify and iTunes play counts, unsorted. 

  


A number of these have been getting airplay on stations like [WFNX](http://wfnx.com/), too, which is my standard radio channel around town.  And you can catch at least two of these groups in the upcoming "[Seaport Six](http://www.livenation.com/event/01004895D38A97FF)" day-long concert, which should be awesome.  I had tickets but had to give them away since I'll be out of the country.  (More on that in an upcoming blog post.)

  


[**The Silversun Pickups**](http://silversunpickups.com/): [Panic Switch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_j7AGSbiYU&feature=relmfu), [Bloody Mary (Nerve Endings)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIO43xfij3s), and more.  I wish they'd tour more on the east coast.  Listen to the chorus lyrics on Panic Switch...

  


  


[**Young the Giant**](http://www.youngthegiant.com/): [My Body](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQYpF2pCkLI), [Cough Syrup](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAsTlnjvetI), and more.  Their whole recent album is good.  
  


  
[**Of Monsters and Men**](http://www.myspace.com/ofmonstersandmenmusic): [Little Talks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghb6eDopW8I), their only track I really like so far, but a good one.  Also, the first MySpace link on this blog in years.  
  


  
**[Metric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(band))**'s [Help I'm Alive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtA7YIFapnY) is fun.  I hope they follow it up with more goodness.  
  
**[Walk the Moon](http://www.reverbnation.com/walkthemoonband)**: [Anna Sun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDVW81bXo0s) is awesome, other songs OK.  Would love to see them live.  
  


  
**[Grouplove](http://www.grouplovemusic.com/)**: [Tongue Tied](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x1wjGKHjBI) rocks, and the rest of the recent album is pretty good too.  They had a show with Young the Giant (above) together in Boston a couple of months ago, which I'm sorry to have missed.  
  


  
The [**Bombay Bicycle Club**](http://www.bombaybicycleclubmusic.com/) is a fun London-based group, and I like their track [Shuffle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDuif301F-8&list=AL94UKMTqg-9AuFJgKRwfuZ96lBljjTckk&index=3&feature=plcp) among others.  I saw them live with a friend here in town back in March.  Apparently they're doing well, playing ever-bigger venues and touring a ton.  I saw them at [The Middle East](http://www.mideastclub.com/) (downstairs), but their next Boston show, in July, is at [Royale](http://royaleboston.com/).  And they're playing [Webster Hall](http://websterhall.com/) in NYC right after that.  
  


  
  
**[Placebo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo_(band))**'s [The Bitter End](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOBeubfr-xY) is not new, just a ton of fun.   
  
Same for **[The Killers](http://www.thekillersmusic.com/band)**' track from years ago, [Somebody Told Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5fBdpreJiU).  Apparently my iTunes has been playing it more recently.  Maybe because of [**Tommy Marth**'s suicide](http://www.tmz.com/2012/04/26/the-killers-saxophone-tommy-marth-dead-suicide/)? :(  
  


  
**[Childish Gambino](http://childishgambino.com/)** has some amazing lyrics, e.g. on [Hold You Down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZQFgXpG6LM&feature=BFa&list=ALYL4kY05133oXnXDW5I6LHrZM-rIN1Nn-) and [Heartbeat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONsTnobkeys).  I really wanted to see his Boston show in June, got tickets, but I will be out of the country (still, same as Seaport Six above).  Enjoy the show, **[Mike](http://graysky.org/)** -- take some pics!  
  


  
**[Rubblebucket](http://rubblebucket.com/)** is one of those bands that is way better in person than recorded.  They bring a ton of energy to their show.  I saw it with a friend a few days ago at the [Paradise](http://www.thedise.com/) here in Boston, a nice small venue.  Their track [Bikes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dNfvHuBkZE) is my favorite.  
  


  
**[Two Door Cinema Club](http://twodoorcinemaclub.com/)**'s [What You Know](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXwYJyrKK5A) is fun.  They too are in the Seaport Six above.  
  
**[The Best Coast](http://www.bestcoast.us/)** has a number of fun tracks, and they'll be in Boston in July.  My favorite of theirs so far is [The Only Place](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoPoRuNTo9U), which I was humming to myself, apparently sometimes loudly, while running a 5K last week.  
  


  
**[The Wombats](http://www.thewombats.co.uk/)**' [Jump Into The Fog](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpadYhXHgwA) is also not new, but it's been playing more recently.  Another UK alt group on my list, huh?  
  


  
Finally, since I have to run, a cute song from **[Frank Turner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Turner)**, [I Still Believe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKkIysX2Bow).  
  


  
A long list, and that's just ~1 genre of music :)  Hopefully others will find it useful, but I know I'll find it amusing years down the road.
