title: Refresh Boston -- Matt Oliphant

Last night [Dharmesh](http://onstartups.com/) and I went to [Refresh Boston](http://refreshboston.org/), a local meetup of developers and designers here in the Boston (duh) area.  There was some mingling, and one talk by [Matt Oliphant](http://xhipi.com/).

  


Matt was good.  I've been reading a lot about usability (both with a lower case u and a capital, Usability) recently.  We've also been applying more of the lessons and best practices at HubSpot.  For example, we now have a real Usability Lab, done the [Krug](http://www.sensible.com/) "10 cents a day" way.  It's great.

  


It was also fun to see some familiar faces, such as [John R](http://ejohn.org/) and [Jon P](http://jonpierce.com/), at the event, and catch up a little.

  


Finally, the [Microsoft Startup Labs](http://mssl.mslivelabs.com/) space is cool.  It was nice of them to host.

  


All in all, a good event.  RefreshBoston stays on the short list.
