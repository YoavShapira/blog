Last night I had dinner at [the Gallows](http://www.thegallowsboston.com/), in Boston's South End neighborhood ([map](http://g.co/maps/qby3e)).  It's a fun, small, local place, with excellent drinks.

The food was good too.  We had some of the [poutine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine), their specialty, as well as roasted beets, shrimp, and fried oysters with runny egg on brioche, which was delicious.  
  
But the drinks were really good.  My favorite, continuing a recent theme for me, was a cocktail based on [Scotch Bonnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_bonnet_(pepper))-infused vodka, which had a really nice kick, but stayed well-balanced.  
  
Service was good, the ambiance nice, and there's plenty of free parking on the street, at least around dinner time.  
  
All in all, a fun local place.
