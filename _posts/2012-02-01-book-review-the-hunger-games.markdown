Last week I started and finished a great book, _[The Hunger Games](http://www.amazon.com/The-Hunger-Games-ebook/dp/B002MQYOFW/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&m=AG56TWVU5XWC2)_.  Enough friends told me I should read it that I just caved and moved it to the top of the queue.  It's also #2 overall in the Kindle store right now, so apparently I'm not the only one raving.

It's an excellent book, highly recommended.  It's the first in a trilogy, and I'm reading the second book right now.  (In fact, I stopped just to write this review, because I imagine I'll want to review the second book as well, and I don't want them to blend together on this blog.)  
  
The book is extremely well-written by [Suzanne Collins](http://www.thehungergames.co.uk/about_the_author).  The universe it describes is epic in size and scope, richly-detailed, and fascinating.  I won't spoil any of the details here, since you should all read the book yourselves.  
  
And there's a movie coming out in March, so you've got a couple of months.  It's an easy read, does not take long, and well worth the time.  
  


  
  
The book reminds me of _[Ender's Game](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003G4W49C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003G4W49C)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=yoasspa-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B003G4W49C)_, one of my all-time SciFi favorites, which is a big compliment.  The sense of hopelessness in the protagonist facing impossible odds, the community tie-ins so it's more than just one against the world, the story and character development, the internal dilemmas faced by key figures, it's all great.  
  
I might be late to the game on this one, but it's a great game ;)  Go read it.
