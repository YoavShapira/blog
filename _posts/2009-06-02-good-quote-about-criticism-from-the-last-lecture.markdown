Rediscovered via [Coding Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001271.html), from **Randy Pausch**'s [Last Lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo):

<blockquote>... when you see yourself doing something badly and nobody's bothering to tell you anymore, that's a very bad place to be. Your critics are your ones telling you they still love you and care.</blockquote>

It's good to keep in mind when giving or receiving criticism.
