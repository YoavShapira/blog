Hard to believe it's been almost 10 months since I last blogged: September 30th, 2014. It's been among the best 10 months of my life, happily filled with much growth, satisfaction, adventures, and smiles.  
  
One of the reasons I've been blogging less is that I've been using other social media tools more. Many things that would have been blog posts in the past now go to [Instagram](https://instagram.com/yoavshapira/)Â or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yoavshapira). I think I'm actually creating more content, not less, but in smaller pieces.  
  
The blog is still useful for longer pieces of writing, of course. But I no longer have any illusion about regular posting here, and don't want to set any expectations.  
  
The last 10 months have brought some significant events, all positive.  
  
First and foremost, I got married :) **Lisa** is amazing, and I couldn't be more excited for our future together.

It was a great journey, with many smart folks working hard, working together, for a remarkable outcome. I feel #blessed that something I helped start grew into a world-class company. Thank you to everyone involved, now and in the past.

I thought the above IPO would increase my desire to retire, or at least significantly relax/chill out. Strangely, the opposite has happened. I'm as driven and hungry as I've ever been, maybe more so.  
  
Work at [Jana](http://www.jana.com/) is going well: we're making great, measurable progress on an awesome mission/vision.

</td></tr></tbody></table>I've been working and traveling enough that I think my fitness has suffered this year. But that's been a relatively known/calculated sacrifice for other good causes. Overall, I'm really lucky and blessed, can't complain at all :)  
  
Happy summer, everyone!
