Yes, the [trip to China](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/search/label/china) was long enough that I got to experiment with books I wouldn't normally read.  But what the heck, diversity is good, and you never know when you'll stumble on a treasure.

  


Unfortunately, _The Thong Also Rises: Further Misadventures from Funny Women on the Road_, is not such a gem.  The three authors (Jennifer Leo, Ayun Halliday, and Laurie Notaro) collected a bunch of stories from women travelers, typically solo travelers.  They try to be funny and insightful, but only a couple are.

  


Skip it.
