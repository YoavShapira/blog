Last night **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I watched _[Transformers 2: Revene of the Fallen](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1055369/)_, with her cousin **Bree**.

  


I really enjoyed the movie, more than I thought I would.  This was also true of the first Transformers movie.  What makes it more fun than I thought are the quality of the special effects, and the humor in the script.

  


There were numerous really funny scenes, laugh-out-loud funny.  It wasn't quite The Hangover, but then again, it didn't set out to be a pure comedy.  The cast is good, the acting good (within the parameters of an action movie, nothing serious), and again, the script is hilarious.

  


It's actually worth watching.  I didn't think I'd be recommending it, but it's fun.
