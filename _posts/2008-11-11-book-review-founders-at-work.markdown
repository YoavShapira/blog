I just finished re-readig [Jessica Livingston](http://ycombinator.com/people.html)'s collection of interviews with startup founders, [Founders at Work](http://www.foundersatwork.com/).  I read most of this when it came out, but I never owned a copy until a couple of months ago.

  


It's a great book, highly recommended.  The stories read almost like short fiction.  Except you know the companies and, in some cases, the people.  It was fascinating.

  


Some strong patterns emerge:

  


- Validate your idea often, ideally by charging money for it.  No substitute for market validation, no matter how fancy the technology.

  


- Be flexible in everything from your technology to your business model, and in between.  So many startups totally change their idea.

  


- The team matters far more than the idea.  Find people who complement your skills.  Don't look to be the sole hero.

  


- Almost all startups have at least one near-death experience.  Some have many.

  


- Solve one bottleneck at a time.  Make an improvement every day in some way, no matter how small.  As long as you keep moving forward, you have a chance.

  


Read it.
