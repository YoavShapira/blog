I love assassin-oriented movies, so I rented "[Hanna](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993842/)" on my Apple TV the other day.  It was a pretty fun movie, though certainly not in the realm of the [**Jason Bourne**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Bourne) films.

Hanna, the protagonist, is a young girl trained to be an assassin by her dad, a former secret agent, it appears.  They are up against some high-ranking government official who wanted to be Hanna's mom, or wanted to have her own kids but couldn't, or both.  It's not really clear.  
  
The movie has some nice action, and overall it's a fun little action flick, but nothing to write home about.  A good film to watch while it's snowing outside.
