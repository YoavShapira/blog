We've started a [new blog here at HubSpot](http://dev.hubspot.com/) for the dev team to muse about tech-related stuff.  I'll be posting most of my HubSpot technical thoughts there from now on, leaving this blog to more personal stuff like product and restaurant reviews.

  


It may not be interesting to most readers of this blog, but just in case, it's at [dev.hubspot.com](http://dev.hubspot.com/).

  


You can also [follow the HubSpot Dev team on Twitter](http://twitter.com/HubSpotTech).
