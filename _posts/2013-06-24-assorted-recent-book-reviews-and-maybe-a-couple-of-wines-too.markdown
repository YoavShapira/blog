I noticed I've stockpiled a couple too many "write a brief book review" tasks in my to-do list, so this is an attempt at clearing them out. None of these are in-depth, but that's OK, since if you care enough you'll read the book (or a sample thereof).

  


**Karin Muller**'s "[Japanland: In Search of Wa](http://www.amazon.com/Japanland-Year-Search-Wa-ebook/dp/B00AZPC3IM/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1)" was fantastic. Every single chapter tells a wonderful story about the author's year in Japan. One of the final stories is about how she undertook the famous [Shikoku pilgrimage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikoku_Pilgrimage). The story of her received [o-settai](http://www.kushima.com/henro/keywords_e/osettai.htm) made me tear up a bit.

I'm a big **[John Rain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rain)** fan, so when **Barry Eisler** came up with a new (relatively...) novel, "[The Detachment](http://www.amazon.com/Detachment-John-Rain-Thrillers-ebook/dp/B005CDHZS0/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1372111272&sr=1-1&keywords=barry+eisler+john+rain)," I snapped it up. It sat unread in my Kindle app for a while, then I randomly noticed it on the beach a couple of weeks ago. Fast-forward about 24 hours later, and I greatly enjoyed the book. All the John Rain novels are a ton of fun, including this one.

I also read the related short story, "[Paris is a Bitch](http://www.amazon.com/Paris-Bitch-Delilah-Short-ebook/dp/B004XQVKR4)," also by Barry Eisler, and much of the same applies, although it all takes place in Paris, without the usual Tokyo shenanigans.

**John Grisham**'s "[Playing for Pizza](http://www.amazon.com/Playing-for-Pizza-ebook/dp/B003B02O00/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1372111460&sr=1-1&keywords=playing+for+pizza)" was the first non-detective, non-lawyer-type book I read from this famous author. It's a well-written, fascinating story about a failed NFL quarterback moving to Italy to play, and adjusting to the local life.

**Sara Gruen**'s "[Water for Elephants](http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/1616200707)" was interesting. I didn't enjoy it as much as friends suggested I would. It's an unusual book, and it's well-written, but I just didn't find it as engaging.

**Alexander Maksik**'s "[You Deserve Nothing](http://www.amazon.com/You-Deserve-Nothing-A-Novel/dp/1609450485)," on the other hand, was great. I don't remember how I found out about this book, but I'm happy I read it.

I'm in the middle of the Singularity Series by **William Hertling**, and it's amazing. There are three books: "[Avogadro Corp](http://www.amazon.com/Avogadro-Corp-Singularity-Appears-ebook/dp/B006ACIMQQ/ref=pd_sim_kstore_1)," "[A.I. Apocalypse](http://www.amazon.com/A-I-Apocalypse-Singularity-Series-ebook/dp/B007FZVI2M)," and coming soon, "The Last Firewall." These books are incredible: fascinating, tight, well-written, wow. I found out about them from the [Feld Thoughts blog](http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2013/06/the-last-firewall-the-best-near-term-science-fiction.html), which is also recommended.

OK, that's the last few weeks of books. While I'm clearing out my to-do list, maybe I'll toss a couple of my fav recent wines on here.

  


Stag's Leap "[Hands of Time](http://www.cask23.com/history/handsOfTime/)" from 2010 was surprisingly smooth and delicious. It's not a wine they bottle on a regular basis, and so it's extra-challenging to obtain, but if you see it, snag a case.

Maybe the most interesting wine I've had recently is an [Alvarelhão](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvarelh%C3%A3o), Forlorn Hope "Suspiro del Moro" 2012, from [Silverspoons Vineyards](http://www.lodiwine.com/tag/silvaspoons-vineyards). It's an unusual grape, small production, especially outside its homeland. The winery also has several other unusual wines, exactly the kind in which I like to invest.

The [Caymus](http://www.caymus.com/) Conundrum, from both 2010 and 2011, has been consistently excellent. A great wine with some raw bar or shellfish on a hot summer day.

My favorite rose of the sprint / summer so far is the [Isola del Nuragi](http://www.vinopedia.com/wine/Argiolas+Serra+Lori+Isola+dei+Nuraghi+IGT) from Serra Lori. It's a great balance of tasty and light. Perfect with some Island Creek Oysters, for example...

Whew, that feels good.
