HubSpot is organizing a [marketing conference](http://www.inboundmarketingsummit.com/) about a month from now, the [Inbound Marketing Summit](http://www.inboundmarketingsummit.com/).  It's a chance for the marketing people in your company / organization to learn why what they're doing is likely as out-dated as the carrier pigeon, and pick up on new tools, technologies, and strategies and will great improve their marketing effectiveness.   
  
No need to buy HubSpot software or become a customer, of course.  And you should tell your marketing person to [register](http://www.inboundmarketingsummit.com/register) this week (by August 8th) using this discount code: 8EHR2.  It will save them some money ;)
