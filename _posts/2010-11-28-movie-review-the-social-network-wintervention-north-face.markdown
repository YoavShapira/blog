I've seen three good movies recently.  They are very different from each other.  This blog post has a brief review of each.  They are in the order I watched them.  
  
_[The Social Network](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/)_ is about Facebook, based on the book _[The Accidental Billionaires](http://www.amazon.com/Accidental-Billionaires-Founding-Facebook-Betrayal/dp/0307740986?ie=UTF8&tag=yoasspa-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=yoasspa-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=0307740986)_ by **[Ben Mezrich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Mezrich)**.  Ben's other book was behind the movie _[21](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478087/)_, which I loved.  And this movie did not disappoint.  It was full of action and told a good story.  Of course, parts of the story are embellished beyond reality, and others just don't make sense, but still, it was a fun movie.  I enjoyed it and I'd watch it again if it comes on TV.  I wonder how accurate the portrayal of **[Mark Zuckerberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg)** really is?  
  
  
  
_[Wintervention](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_qNBysg8Rc)_ is the latest **[Warren Miller](http://www.skinet.com/warrenmiller/)** film.  We saw this one with a couple of friends on opening night at Northeastern.  The crowd was nice and loud, full of fun folks.  They had an MC and one or two of the snowboarders in the movie also present in person.  The movie itself was long, far longer than I thought it would be, but fun to watch.  Every time I watch one of those, I just want to get out snowboarding right away.

In fact, that movie helped play a role in my decision to get back into snowboarding this season.  I just bought a new board (a Rossi Circuit mid-wide 161cm 2010 edition), and some other new gear.  Alli and I have to coordinate schedules and plan some trips.  
  
Finally, I just recently watched the movie _[North Face](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844457/)_.  This movie was made in 2008, and it's in German.  It tells the story of a famous expedition to climb (first ascent) the north face of the [Eiger mountain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiger) in Switzerland.  The expedition is a tragic story, as it turns out, and they all die, but the movie is poignant and worth watching. Caution: if it makes you sad when the main protagonists die, don't watch this film.  
  
I didn't think the protagonists would die.  I figured since parts of the route, especially the Hinterstroisser traverse, are named after them, that they must have done the successful first ascent.  I was wrong, much to **Alli**'s dismay, since this type of movie frustrates her.
