Mostly busy working.  Coming back to [HubSpot](http://dev.hubspot.com) after a vacation outside the country has been a whirlwind, just as expected.  It's an exciting place to work.

  


I have a huge blogging backlog.  A number of book reviews, restaurant reviews, and other random thoughts.  Sorry for the delays.
