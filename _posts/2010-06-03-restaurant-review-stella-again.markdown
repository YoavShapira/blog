Last Monday (Memorial Day) **[Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/)** and I had a great dinner in the South End, at [Stella](http://www.bostonstella.com/).  We'd been there before, and had a good meal the first time too.  This time we also had excellent company in **Kate** and **Art**, beautiful weather, and great food.  
  
My orecchiette with spicy sausage were excellent, as was Alli's creamy linguine.  Kate and Art both had fish, which were well-prepared and delicious.  A couple of nicely-matched Italian reds finished things up well.  
  
Even desserts were good: we had some sorbet and some cannoli, and the server brought out some tiramisu as well.  Service was very good all-around: not too pushy, friendly, happy, and fairly knowledgeable.  
  
All in all, we had a great time.  We'll definitely go back there again in the future.
