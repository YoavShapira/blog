[2005 Raymond Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon](http://www.snooth.com/wine/raymond-reserve-napa-cabernet-sauvignon-2005/): two Napa cabs in a row ;)  It's been a good couple of weeks.

  


This is a classic cab, all black currant, strong up front, smooth finish.  The nice aging effect some Napa vineyards have, with almost no acidity at all.

  


It's a little more expensive than the [Cannonball I just reviewed](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2009/10/wine-review-2006-cannonball-cabernet.html), and tastes a little better.  But not much.  The Cannonball is a better bargain.
