Part of my job at HubSpot, the [inbound marketing company](http://www.hubspot.com), is recruiting.  I'm always looking out for talented, entrepreneurial engineers to join our kick-ass team.  So I tend to spend a bit of time on social networking sites like [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) looking at bios and profiles.

  


Here's a snippet I came across today:

  


<blockquote>Management of Software Projects from for all stages from concept, through Marketing Requirements Definitions, SRS, Project Management, Outsourcing, QA and deployment.</blockquote>

What's missing here?  How about development of the software in ways other than outsourcing?

  


Strange.  I happen to know the person whose profile is from, and he's a smart guy.  A nice guy, too.  But that's a weird view of "all stages" of software development.

  


(The above is from a public profile, so I'm not violating anyone's privacy.  You can find it if you Google patiently enough.)
