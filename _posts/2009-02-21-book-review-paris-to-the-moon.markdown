Last night I finished reading [Adam Gopnik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Gopnik)'s [Paris to the Moon](http://www.amazon.com/Paris-Moon-Adam-Gopnik/dp/0375758232), a collection of essays about this writer's life with his family in Paris (France).  
  
The author is from New York, but he moved to Paris for 5 years (1995 - 2000), to write there.  He moved with his wife and young son, and they had another child in Paris.

Overall the book is good.  It's fun to read, and it contains a lot of detailed, colorful descriptions of Parisian life.  The writing is mostly tight and engaging, and there are a handful of passages that were so good I re-read them out loud to [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com/) on the spot.  
  
At some places, especially when talking about French philosophy, the writing is a bit verbose and long-winded for my taste.  But I supposed that's almost a truism for that specific topic.  
  
The descriptions of the differences between France and the US are spot-on, I think.  So are the descriptions of the differences between French people and Americans.  Those alone are worth reading the book.  
  
Overall, a good read, especially if you like Paris or France, or travel essays.
