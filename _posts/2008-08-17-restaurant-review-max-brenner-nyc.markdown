Last Sunday, while still in NYC (see [hotel](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2008/08/hotel-review-mandarin-oriental-nyc.html) and [dinner](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2008/08/restaurant-review-asiate-nyc.html) reviews), [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com) and I met David and Robyn for brunch at [Max Brenner](http://www.maxbrenner.com/)'s.  As an Israeli, I was already familiar with Max Brenner and their amazing chocolate creations.  But I still really wanted to try a brunch there, NYC-style.  
  
It did not disappoint.  For a sweet tooth like me, the menu is truly eye-popping.  It's like a chocoholic's wet dream (somewhat literally).  I really didn't know what to pick.  At the end I went with this marshmallow chocolate crepe thing, which was delicious.  The others got some savory things, not sweets, and those were great as well.  
  
Overall it's a very cool brunch place right in [Union Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Square_%28New_York_City%29).  If you can get a table, it's a fun place to eat.
