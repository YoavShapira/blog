Last Saturday night, [in NYC](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2008/08/hotel-review-mandarin-oriental-nyc.html), we had dinner at [Asiate](http://www.mandarinoriental.com/newyork/dining/asiate/default.aspx).  This restaurant, which also happens to be in the [Mandarin Oriental](http://yoavs.blogspot.com/2008/08/hotel-review-mandarin-oriental-nyc.html) hotel, was very good but not amazing.  
  
The view is to die for, just like the view from the rooms of the hotel.  The menu is appealing, offering a nice range of dishes.  The prices are not horrible, especially for NYC.  It's not like an amazing value place, but it doesn't feel like a rip-off either.  
  
The wine list is a bit more on the expensive side, offering very little in terms of reasonably-priced or value wines.  That was a bit off-putting.  They did have some amazing vintages (at amazing prices), which always amuses me.  We had a [2001 Le Pupille Safreddi](http://www.carlorussowine.com/186029), an excellent wine, but it was expensively prices like all the others.  
  
The food was good but not exceptional by any means.  In fact, although it's only been a week, I only remember a couple of blog-worthy dishes.  David had the [Wagyu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagyu) steak, which looked and tasted marvelous.  One or two appetizers were also excellent.  A middle-of-the-meal, palate-cleansing black truffle souffle was outstanding.  The rest of the meal, including most entrees, was just a wash.   
  
Service was very good.  The atmosphere / ambiance were also very nice.  Overall, it was a nice place, but probably not worth going back to.  There are plenty of other places to splurge on food in the City, so we'll try something else next time.
