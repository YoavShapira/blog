Last night [Alli](http://allisonshapira.com) and I saw the movie [Defiance](http://www.defiancemovie.com/).  It's a story about resistance fighters ("[partisans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_partisans)") duing the Holocaust, and how they hide from and fight the Germans in the forests, trying to scrape by.  It's a true story, or at least based on one, and it's pretty inspiring.

  


Specifically, it's the story of the [Bielski partisans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bielski_partisans), named after the three brothers who led this particular resistance group.  They started with nothing, their parents were killed, but slowly they grew the group, built camps, and fought back a bit here and there.  Against overwhelming odds, needless to say.

  


We both really enjoyed the movie.  It's sobering and it makes you appreciate your life, that's for sure.
