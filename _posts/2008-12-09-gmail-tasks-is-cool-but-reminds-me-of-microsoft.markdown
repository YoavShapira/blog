title: GMail tasks is cool, but reminds me of Microsoft

[GMail now has a built-in task manage](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/new-in-labs-tasks.html)r, which is cool.  I'll probably use it, although I tend to just use my inbox as a cheap man's to-do list.

  


But the feature announcement reminds me of [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/), in that it cannibalizes a decent partner, [Remember The Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/).  It's a bit David vs. Goliath-ish, with RTM as David obviously.  

  


M$ played the Goliath role for a long time, nurturing small partners until it ate them up.  In recent years, I think it's improved, with Microsoft as likely to buy as to compete outright.

  


Is Google heading down the same path?
