Earlier this week I played [golf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf) for the first time ever, and I had a blast.  I won't bore you with all the details, but suffice it to say I would not mind playing again some time soon.  Of course I played minigolf before, and enjoyed it, but the real deal is much different.

  


I played with some fellow [internet marketing experts](http://www.hubspot.com) from HubSpot, and since it was my first time (along with a couple of other players), we had some lessons first.  The teachers were nice, friendly, and helpful.  The game itself is hard, requiring much mechanical tuning and usage of muscles I don't often use, especially in the back.

  


I got some (few) good strokes in during the lessons, and then we join the rest of the team for the back nine holes of the course.  I didn't contribute much to the team, but had a great time.  Everyone was very patient and took time out to help my game with tips and advice.

  


I did get a couple of good shots in there, which was satisfying.  Obviously I would have to play golf for years just to get to a less embarrassing level, but you gotta start somewhere, right?

  


It was a lot of fun watching the other players, who are much more accomplished.  To my untrained eye, it looked very much like golf on TV, except it's more impressive up close and once you know how hard it is.

  


And just as I find a new outdoor sport, the weather today felt much cooler ;)

  


Thank you to our organizer and host, David.
