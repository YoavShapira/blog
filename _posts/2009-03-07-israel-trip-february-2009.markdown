Alli and I spent most of last week in [Israel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel), visiting the family.  It was a lot of fun, as always.

  


I'm really lucky to have a large, loving, and supporting family.  Every time I visit them in Israel I'm reminded of this fact.  I wanted to publicly acknowledge it.

  


The official purpose of this trip was to celebrate my grandfather's 80th birthday.  Happy birthday Saba!  Not bad for someone who survived the [Holocaust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust) as a young kid, while the entire rest of his family was killed.

  


For his birthday, we took Saba on a trip throughout Israel.  We re-traced the steps he took when he immigrated to the country right after the Holocaust.  It was both educational and emotional.  To do it as a nearly-complete family was very cool.

  


There are plenty of pictures from the trip, but they're mostly on Facebook.  If you're friends with me on Facebook, you've probably seen them already.  I'm not going to post them here.
